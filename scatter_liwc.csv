, was her response. so i tried... and got in! finally i would be doing what i love programming, but for video games! at this stage i was smoking quite a bit, but did not really care. i will stop when my study starts. be me. be . first day of my dream degree. it was amazing. the high of the first few days faded quickly and i realised how hard this will be. for the first time in my life i would have to face my demons do the work! fight my own doubt! my girlfriend of then years was doing what she loved at the same time and was incredibly busy. she was so busy that i started seeing her less and less. and if i saw her she was exhausted, so i never wanted to bother her with the struggles i was having. i noticed her being on an emotional high from her work and i did not feel like i fit in her life anymore. mentioning that to her of course, as you can imagine, was a huge mistake and a few weeks later we broke up. reality hits you hard bro. suddenly a lot of things fell into place and i took one look at my life and realised, life has been treating me nice, so better be wise... i admitted to myself i probably have a drug problem. and i have been carrying depression with me since i first lay in bed as a kid crying without really knowing why. most importantly i realised i need her. so i told her. she understood, but she could not go back. not yet. not now. maybe never. we broke of contact for a while. after being separated for a few months, she and my best friend i have known since we were started dating and i finally collapsed. i went all in depression and started numbing the pain with more green than i can remember. be me. be . suicidal with the feeling that i lost everything. i could not go on studying. i just wanted to quit. but i had and still have amazing friends and family that cared. so i finally swallowed my pride and found myself a therapist. i put my studies on hold. i went to see my therapist twice a week. that was one year ago. i kept smoking a secret from my therapist for quite a while since that was not part of my problem . a few months ago i finally confessed to her my therapist . i needed to stop blazing. i need to hear myself think again, even if it is painful. i went months without before relapsing hard. i will never be better... this is how i die. in a cloud of sweet smoke but my unconscious mind was not having any of it. very soon i got insane panic attacks from smoking to the point that i could not go see my therapist. so finally... be me. be . one week into withdrawal. i am really skinny, because i hardly ate the first few days and still find i incredibly difficult. hyper realistic dreams that seem endless alternate between me being together with my ex again and me killing either her, my former best friend, both, myself or everyone. vivid imagination does not help if you dream of bloody murder or beautiful happiness that you lost. today is day and i feel pretty shitty. i hardly slept and i feel exhausted. i have an assignment due in two weeks that decides if i am allowed continue to study. one thing i know. today is not relapse day. you know what helped? you! reading this subreddit. reading your struggles and knowing i am not alone and so are not you. to anyone who read this. kudos. you have my sincerest respect and i hope you are doing well. i might stop lurking finally and posting more i think. trying to help others. i think i might be good at that and it is a worthwhile thing to do. i am not going to proof read this text, since writing it was painful enough. i hope you do not mind. i do not. i want to end with a quote that brought tears to my eyes today and gave me a little boost. for the times when you truly need to rely only on you in the darkest times hope is something you give yourself. that is the meaning of inner strength. iroh thanks again, and i will see you around",addiction

11.690848,-7.3291855,"i want to quit marijuana, but do not know where exactly to begin i was a late bloomer. my journey with marijuana began my senior year of high school. i met a classmate who used to deal and we would go to the nearby park after school, smoke and get pizza. i had tried marijuana prior to meeting her but did not get any of the so called effects , so i never had a strong interest in marijuana until i met her. i will never forget the first time i properly inhaled. it finally hit me with an epic euphoric sensation, my senses were so enhanced! music sounded better, food was incredibly delicious and i enjoyed sharing my contemplations and introspective thoughts with others. i felt more at ease . this was just the beginning of an unhealthy dependence. upon graduating high school i spent the entire summer months looking to get high. if i could not meet with friends who had weed, i would go to the smoke shop and buy k spice. at the time, i was living in a state that legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes and while i could have easily got a card i was still living with my parents who were extremely conservative and did not approve of medicinal marijuana. i quickly learned how bad k spice was and immediately switched back to marijuana. i left home for college that fall and that is when all the trouble really seemed to have begun i met dealers, most of my classmates had access to weed and it was very easy to obtain so i spent most, if not all, of my money on purchasing weed. i would often skip class to smoke weed with my girlfriend and as a result, i dropped out of college because i just did not have the attention span nor interest to stay in school. this is a mistake i am still paying for to this day. i am now years of age, i have a good job though i could have had a better job had i maintained consistency in college. i still do not have a college degree but i have managed to get through life without struggling too much, i would mainly attribute this to my privelege. my family has footed the bill more than enough times in my life. so here i am. i want to stop smoking weed. i hate that i spend my money on it, i hate that i am coming to the realization that i did not have the maturity to handle weed in my younger years because i consummed it excessively. i spent years smoking with girls i was dating and neglected friends. if i was not speaking to a girl, i was texting my dealer to score. recently i have come to the conclusion that i am an addict and though my consumption is a lot different than how i used mariijuana before, it is still something that i have continuously used from the ages of . the most i have gone without marijuana is a mere days and that was two years ago... i have been with my girlfriend for years now and she is a marijuana smoker her usage is not chronic, she limits herself to after work and to induce appetite, she does not need to smoke but does anyway.. , some of the people we have in common also smoke as well as most of her friends. i am surrounded by people who smoke so how i do go about sobriety? i have come to a place where i do not need to score at all but man, if a blunt gets offered to me it is rare that i will ever turn it down. i want to take this seriously, i want to start getting rid of toxins and sugars i consume on a daily basis. i know that i am comfortably drifting by in life. the thing that has significantly improved my quality of life is my add meds, without them, i would just be a bum on a log. this prescribed stimulant has allowed me to maintain a job, meet deadlines and keep myself motivated when i would otherwise abandon my commitments. sometimes my meds make me feel sick and marijuana is the only thing that helps me sleep or eat. i am not in a place of sheer, utter hopelessness but i want to quit. i need to quit.",addiction

-14.684594,-9.408876,"today marks day ! here is some things that have helped me. i quit smoking days ago after years of daily use multiple times per day, i should add , and i feel like i am finally over the uphill climb that seemed to go on forever. for the first week or two, i did not have much of an appetite, could not fall asleep, and was generally very irritable. one of the ways i combated these feelings was cutting back a lot of my caffeine intake. i normally would drink cups of coffee daily, but i found that without cannabis to sort of counter its effects, i felt super anxious and wired all the time, like i was constantly fighting off an anxiety attack. staying off coffee for a couple of weeks really helped me with these feelings, and falling asleep as well. i am now drinking cups every day sometimes every other day and i feel great. for the first weeks, the dreams were super intense, and usually nightmare ish. one benefit was i had several lucid dreams, which are always fun! but i think i can safely say my sleep is fantastic now, my appetite is back, and the dreams are awesome! as others have mentioned, dreaming of using again is a very common thing. it happens times per week to me, and i always feel guilty in my dream that i am doing it again, only to be super relieved when i wake up and realize it was just a dream. i am so much more motivated to participate in my classes i am a graduate student, so being an anxious in your head stoner was really holding me back , and i no longer dread small talk with people. in fact, i find myself smiling more at people, not afraid to maintain eye contact, and generally am in a really good mood these days. i have even made some new friends at the gym as my intense social anxiety is slowly dissipating. anyway, i hope this encourages some of you that it really is worth it. it is a night and day difference in my head, once your brain chemistry sorts itself back to its normal state. sometimes your emotional responses in certain situations are going to feel brand new to you, and that is completely normal. you kind of need to re learn how to handle these feelings, but you will be better for it in the end. i promise. tl dr cut back on caffeine to combat negative withdrawals, enjoy your vivid dreams, do not be concerned when your emotional responses seem different than they used to. it will all be worth it in the end.",addiction

gradually increased from a hit occasionally to bowls in the evening every single day, with weekends being from the minute i woke up until i passed out. using i m only days into quitting and realized why i used due to so added clarity. it was my escape, similar to a lot of people on here. it put me on an island by myself that i could watch everything else going on around me without feeling anything. i escaped from a stressful job, i escaped from a toxic relationship, i escaped from my own anxiety, depression and life in general. wake up, go to work, come home, smoke, play some video games, eventually sleep. it was rinse and repeat day after day. i was surviving life, not living it. the lead up gradually life had just become a lot. i moved to a different city for a new job. the job was a blessing and a curse as it absolutely wrecked me with its demands. some days i hit hour days putting out major fires . beyond that, my new job took me away from my girlfriend and a relationship that with added clarity, i realized was very toxic and adding to my stress. then i got sick, constant stomach issues. puking every damn morning and going nauseated all day long. as an athlete, i saw my entire body change and health drop. added more stress, my dad had a heart attack and kept falling. was traveling non stop because i didn t know what day would be the last. i was in constant fear. then i started getting heart palpitations... i bought a bp monitor. was always registering in stage hypertension. with all this, i was burning away until i could no longer think or feel. the wake up call one day i didn t eat because the nausea was so intense of course throwing up and dry heaving every morning didn t help, and worked a full day eating a lousy snack for lunch. i got home and for some reason made myself run miles in degree heat yup, aware this was dumb , i didn t prep dinner until because my girlfriend was driving up. i was sitting on the couch, i heard the beep from the oven timer. i had just taken two hits and got up to go get our food. as i walk into the kitchen i feel really light headed. i grab and lean onto the counter. . . i wake up on the floor with tunnel vision, my hands and arms shaking uncontrollably, and my girlfriend screaming, crying, through crazy tunnel vision unable to hear anything. this lasted about seconds. it was beyond scary to say the least, i then went into shock for the next couple hours. sweating but freezing, goosebumps all over my entire body, panic attacks it was horrifying. when i came to, every bad thought that could have came into my mind, did. i thought i was dying, i had a heart attack it runs in my family, my grandfather had his first when he was died at , and i was . i have since gone to a cardiologist and all has checked out fortunately. clarity and action with this episode and a rather unkind reminder in the form of a large dent in my refrigerator door that broke my fall, of how far stress and increased use had taken me i had to make changes. i quit june nd, i quit cold turkey and paid the piper. night sweats being the absolutely worst, nausea, throwing up, lack of appetite, you name a shitty symptom i had it. only started to subside after weeks in, with no improvements in insomnia yet unfortunately. forward a week in, i began to realize i had to take steps to help myself and reduce stress since i couldn t just numb myself to it anymore. i did a hard thing, i broke things off with my girlfriend of years, i visited my dad and realized i can t just wait for that dreaded call and be comfortable with getting it, started to eat healthy, and started working out again. my stomach issues have almost completely resolved themselves. i think i was one of the rare few who actually get sick from too much use, also, without medication, my blood pressure dropped substantially from quitting use and is now normal, and my heart palpitations are a complete rarity. ending a stressful relationship, and coming to accept my father could pass at any time and taking other steps necessary are helping me to improve my life from taking an active role again. oh, and i m starting to socialize with friends and am even making new ones. the ending i don t know where this will take me, but i am optimistic and can already tell it will be better than the place i was. reading all of your posts has given me insight and courage. thanks for being open and honest. it makes a difference. especially when your questioning yourself due to insomnia at am when temptation is at its highest.

hoping for permission to resume using, i did some online research on the effects of trees and pregnancy, and at best, the results seemed inconclusive there were some the plural of anecdote is data articles that claimed it increased the risk of complications, low birthweight, et al, and even pro trees websites were not able to say anything more promising than there is not enough research to show that it is definitely safe or harmful. i read one article, about a pregnant woman in oregon whose doctor wrote her a prescription to treat her pregnancy induced nausea and anxiety upon reading, i barked an angry, jealous laugh at her nausea and anxiety is part of pregnancy, lady! , whose kid was born premature and with complications, and the article was about her contemplating breastfeeding while continuing to use, about doctors warning her against potentially hurting her child is neurological development. my mind was made up i was not going to risk hurting my baby, or even wondering but not knowing if i would hurt my baby. i did not want my baby whisked off to the nicu because i could not control my addiction i did not want to watch my kid struggle in school ten years from now, wondering if their problems were my fault. i certainly did not want to risk a battle with child protective services if thc was ever found in the blood urine of me or my newborn. i did not want to be that lady in oregon. my pregnancy was putting me through hell, but like the churchill saying goes when you are going through hell, keep going. shortly after that, while home alone and feeling nauseated and lonely and sad, i opened back up my stash box, smelling my grinder, contemplating my little baggie, which still had about a bowl is worth remaining, plus a considerable amount of kief in the bottom of my grinder. i knew, knew that i was too vulnerable to have it in the house, that i was either going to smoke it and finally get relief from my vomiting and panic attacks, or that i needed to get rid of it. i dumped the baggie in the toilet and ran the grinder under the sink, crying as i watched it rinse away. really, i should have removed the temptation earlier. there were a couple of benefits to detoxing during my first trimester first, i slept really well . i have always been bad at sleeping trees had been my insomnia cure for years, and the first time i tried to quit, the insomnia was one of the worst parts about it. however, women in their first trimester tend to sleep really hard, really long, and i had no trouble falling asleep and staying asleep due to my body is response to pregnancy. another benefit i could blame all my emotional symptoms on the pregnancy. the first time i tried to quit, i did nothing but mope and cry as a result, and felt terribly guilty for inflicting my sad sack self on loved ones this time, i got nothing but sympathy and love and awww, the pregnant lady is crying again, those baby hormones are really something! whenever i broke down, and i wo not lie, that helped a lot, that i never felt blamed or judged for being the weepy hermit that i sometimes needed to be. to cope, i took the following steps, which i would recommend to anybody in my position get the trees out of your house. i should have done this earlier, myself, but it took me about a month between quitting and flushing, because i was not ready to let go of the safety net feeling of having the option. i would have tortured myself much less if i would just gotten rid of everything sooner. take all the advice you can find on coping with nausea. for me, this included wearing sea bands basically , nibbling on tummy gentle foods regularly, sucking on peppermints other pregnant people find lemon or ginger candy helpful , drinking lots of unflavored carbonated water others find ginger ale soothing , and avoiding known nausea triggers, like strong smells or leaning over too quickly. seriously, there are a million anti nausea suggestions out there, and they wo not all work for anybody, but some of them will work for everybody. try them all and make a note of and stick with whatever works for you. avoid anything that triggers your craving to use. for me, i had my husband rearrange the house to put the television in another room, to break my this is where i sit and pack my bowl and watch tv physical habit i also stopped watching tv shows and reading blogs that featured celebrated trees usage they just made me jealous and angry! . also, do not hang out with people who are stoned. i am lucky in that my husband had no problem quitting with me he only smoked occasionally anyway , but if the person who knocked you up is also a regular smoker, it is definitely time for them to quit in solidarity with you. take advantage of the hard sleep you get in the first several weeks of pregnancy, but when this phase of pregnancy ends, you will be faced with the eternal pregnant at night problem waking up to pee constantly. to fall back asleep quickly, never ever ever look at your phone when you wake up, and do not turn on the lights when you go to the bathroom use a nightlight or just leave on the hallway light with the door open, but do not expose yourself to any overhead lights or electronic glare. this one took me a while to figure out, but my falling back asleep time went from minutes to less than minutes once i made this change. the nightmares are probably going to be intense. pregnant people get hardcore dreams, and people quitting trees get hardcore dreams, and holy shit, i hate to report this, but i still get horrible nightmares almost every night, probably nights a week. i do not have any good tips for this, other than remembering nightmares are like poops, in that your body makes them so you can get shit out of your system, and once you wake up, do not dwell on them or try to remember them, just let them flush away. with the people who knew about your trees habit, brag about quitting! you will get nothing but support, and people will be relieved to hear that you have quit. do not be shy about telling them how hard it is been you are doing something hard, and those who love you will have no trouble understanding why it is hard, and why you are doing it anyway. and truly, anybody who is not fully supportive of a pregnant person not smoking really does not belong in your life anymore. so, where am i now? healthy, sober, and with a pregnancy that is humming along perfectly! i just had my week ultrasound, and everything looked great all indicators are normal, the baby is the right size, and i am proud of myself for taking care of both of us. it is been some of the hardest few months of my life, but the reward of knowing that i have taken my pregnancy this far and that all is well has made this huge change worth it. i ca not wait to meet my baby daughter in a few months! for obvious reasons, this is a throwaway reddit account, but i am happy to answer any questions people may have, particularly from people who are either pregnant or trying to conceive while simultaneously trying to quit. take care, everybody!",addiction

18.38226,27.411953,"could anyone have said anything that would have gotten you to stop? i was a slave to drugs and alcohol for seven years. it started with alcohol, marijuana and amphetamines in college, then moved on to opioids, methamphetamine, and literally everything else after college. i went up and down over the years sometimes i would be a little better, sometimes i would be a lot worse. but i was drinking every day first three to four beers, then half a pint of hard liquor, then by the end, a pint a day. and it is funny that what finally brought me to my knees was not the heroin, or the methamphetamine, or the tranquilizers just the alcohol and a little over the counter stimulant called propylhexedrine, which you can buy in all sorts of places, especially up here in the northeast. i did it every day for two years straight. i shudder to think of what i did to my body in that time. i had all sorts of therapists and all kinds of talks over those seven years with my parents, with my friends, with random strangers at the occasional na meeting i would attend when i got too crazy even for myself. i heard all the old warnings and dire premonitions you are going to die , you are going to kill someone else , you are going to lose everything you worked so hard for . i had all kinds of great conversations, but they never meant anything. i would walk out of the therapist is office, or the na meeting, or whatever friend is house i would been to, and on my way home i would pick up a fresh pint of cuervo and a fresh benzedrex inhaler regardless. the words just would not stick. they just did not matter next to that urge, that drowning, snarling, yearning urge, to medicate my mind. it did not matter what i said to myself, or to anybody else. i was hopeless. and i was going to die. i used to cry myself to sleep a lot of nights, knowing that i was killing myself, knowing that i could feel my body dying and wake up the next day and do it all over again just the same. nine months ago today, that finally changed. nine months ago today, i did the thing i am most ashamed of in my life. i was dating a woman, a kind, gentle, sincere, wonderful woman, whom i tried to love. but i could not love her then. it was not her fault. i was too broken. i did not know who i was enough to be able to love somebody else. but like a lot of addicts, i did not think anything of that when i got into the relationship. a year and a half later, i was unhappy, but too weak to do what i ought to have done. so instead, like an addict does, i just did the easy thing and cheated on her. was i black out drunk? yes. was i tweaking on propylhexedrine? yes. but it does not matter. i knew what i was doing. i knew it was wrong. and i did it anyways. because just like with the drugs themselves, everything i told myself, and everything i believed about right and wrong, did not matter. i wanted what i wanted. and that was that. it is been nine months, and the guilt and shame still wash over me at least once a day. i broke up with her, and like a coward, i never told her. yes, i should have. maybe i still should now. she knows something happened, but she wo not speak to me anymore. i do not blame her. and i do not want to cause her any more pain. see what i never imagined when i did that awful thing was how immutable it is. she knows that something happened, and she is smart as hell, so i will bet she guesses what it was. but regardless, i broke her heart, left her in loneliness and despair, and there is nothing i can do now to make it better. no kind words or prophetic wisdom i can speak to somehow make it all okay. to her it will always just be something awful to get over. but as screwed up as it all is, and as much as i regret doing that, what really gets me is that horrible, shameful, disgusting decision i made that night played a key roll in saving my life. see, ever since that night, i have not had the urge to drink. not even once. and i am sure that i do not have to tell a lot of readers of this subreddit what a damn miracle that is. the urge was always too strong for me. i could never get enough sober time in to resist it. but now when i see people drinking, or smell the scent of alcohol, in a flash, i remember that night, and what i did. and when i do, i feel sick. and it renews my hatred of drinking and using even more. what a strange thing, to have something so shameful, be the source of such unanticipated rebirth. god truly works in mysterious ways. i hope that god shows the same providence towards her that he has shown towards me or she...or whatever . anyways, that is the rough outlines of my story, with a lot of details left out. i wrote all this just because i wanted to ask others a question that i ask myself constantly is there anything anyone can say? when we see those who are still suffering under the yoke of addiction, who persist in their disease even as it destroys everything they hold dear, what can we say that will make a difference? is there anything at all?

kind of attitude. except it didn t stop after a glass or two at lunch, that glass just kept getting very slowly topped up, all afternoon, and all evening. i guess i d developed such a high tolerance by this stage that i was still capable of performing my job reasonably well, which enabled me to justify my actions. from onwards i have rarely felt even tipsy owing to this tolerance and it would take a pretty early start and big day socialising, mixing beers, spirits and wine wedding, cricket match, that kind of thing for me to feel even slightly inebriated. while i rarely got drunk, i had alcohol with me all the time, a vodka and tonic disguised in a ribena bottle maybe. it wouldn t matter what we did art gallery, museum, sports, parks i would always make sure i had alcohol to hand. amazingly i also barely ever suffered from hangovers and perhaps passed out in a hedge once or twice but that s it, so it s not that my life really became properly unmanageable that led me to question my lifestyle, but more a sense of looking forward and considering my responsibilities as a parent and partner that brought me here. just for perspective, and average day was probably bottles of wine, a bad day was bottles and litres of pale ale this is for those from the us, in the uk it is pints! . red wine has always been my chief poison, specifically decent bordeaux and burgundy, which helped with kidding myself that i was at least a semi classy wino! my kids are and , and with my partner out earning me considerably, it made sense for our family to have me as the main carer. this worked ok as they went from part time nursery to school, because i d just about be able to keep myself under the driving limit for . pm, so i could drive them to activities after school. similarly i figured, at the weekends if we went to visit family out of town, i d do the drive out in the morning on saturday, my partner would do the drive back on sunday night always , and i kidded myself this was fair. however, i knew deep down that as my kids got older, they d need taking to all kinds of things in the evenings, and it just wasn t going to be fair to my partner or my kids for me to not be capable to driving them to and from these activities. i still don t quite know what led to my personal epiphany but sometime in august last year i decided i had to try and get a grip. i had a couple of counselling sessions and tried to moderate and kept failing. figured i had to do something more extreme so got a course of chlordiazepoxide benzos from my docs and detoxed at home for about days, followed by campral acamprosate for months, which is supposed to reduce cravings. i guess it worked in the sense that months and a couple of days later, i haven t had a drink in this period. for most of this period, i have just felt weird, like my body isn t my own, though having joined lots of fb groups like this one, many people seemed to say this improves after days and i suppose i am starting to feel a little better now. i ve used hash throughout this period in the hope it would help, and i think it has. while i have used marijuana most of my adult life, i have had breaks from it intermittently, so don t feel i have anything like the same level of dependency as i did with alcohol. i also thought it sensible to tackle once vice at a time. so far, so good and possibly worth mentioning i drink a bunch of alcohol free beers and ciders every day until about a month ago, when i acquired some xanax and temazepam, thinking it would allow me to get a little toasted at xmas and help quell the feeling of missing out when surrounded by lots of pretty drunk people. i will finish this stash very shortly and don t think it s created any fresh problem s for me, but it has made me think wtf am i doing? i promised myself a year without alcohol and i can and will do that but why on earth would i jeopardise that by doing this new thing, and pathetically justifying it to myself that it s a one off, they re not proper drugs etc. i reminds me of a moment i had just before xmas when i went to visit my folks on the south coast. we found a lovely stretch for a walk where these beautiful scott s pine trees lead down steep steps to an unspoilt beach and as i watched partner and little girls descend ahead of me and i took a deep breath and just took in the beauty of the scene and what did i think? i thought, damn, i wish i d brought my pipe so i could just get a hit of ganja to make this picture even better, and immediately felt sick to my stomach. i m with the three souls i love most in the world, in a beautiful place and among my first thoughts is to improve the situation with a narcotic? how fucked up is that. if there has ever been a moment where i felt like a fucking awful dad as well as a despicable human being, it was then. i m crying my eyes out now so i ll bring this to an end. this is where i am and how i got here. i suppose i was prompted to write this in response to seeing another member s post about a feeling of emptiness and her struggles of how to deal with it. perhaps this is what i have too and i need to identify it, take responsibility and figure out a way to quiet this voice. another poster also commented on how she had no idea what led her to the situation she found herself in and i can identify with this too. i have zero excuses, my family aren t wealthy but i was lucky enough to get scholarships for the best education possible in the uk, so had fantastic opportunities and grew up in a family full of love. i ve had good jobs, mates, girlfriends, i should have no demons and yet still i struggle. it almost makes me feel a sham, like i have no right to be this fucked up. currently i am trying to get some treatment but it seems there isn t any proper provision from people qualified in clinical psychology on the nhs at the moment and i m not working currently so can t afford to go private. there s plenty of counselling all over the place, but i don t need tea and sympathy, i need some rigorous psychiatric analysis and it seems you only get that for free here in the uk once you re truly in the gutter and homeless, which is kind of short sighted but it is what it is. i tried going to a couple of aa meetings here but found them profoundly depressing and their characterisation of this as a disease and people being powerless really doesn t sit well with me at all. if anyone has found a particular type of treatment that has worked well for them in terms of unearthing the reasons for their behaviour, then i d love to hear about them. if you feel weak, or scared, or, like me, hate yourself sometimes, maybe it s helpful to talk about that too, i m totally happy to chat just drop me a message i know that just writing this has been extremely cathartic for me. wishing you all love and strength on your respective journeys.",alcoholism

-6.1099973,7.667675,"going into my th week hello all. i am very hopeful this is the place for me. i reached a place where i was anhedonic and down all day every day, and drinking, my crutch for almost years, was not helping. i had acid reflux so bad i could barely eat. since drinking was not working as a medicine and i was suffering so much from the reflux, i decided to do a day cleanse . about a week into it, it was like a switch flipped in my mind. drinking was scary to me. i was scared to go back. i made the choice to keep going and firmly not drink for as long as i felt this way. there were some moments where i missed not drinking per se, but the feeling of contentment with life and the treat of a good glass of wine. it is been scarily easy? i wonder if i am a dry drunk, but my body, mind and heart is so on board with not drinking it is making it strangely easy. i feel an almost physical repulsion when i think about it. like a big stop sign. i am so, so, so grateful for that. i do not know where it came from or why, but i thank the universe for this gift every day. i was not anywhere near bottom. i did not even think i had a problem. but weeks in, i am struggling with towering rage and rollercoaster emotions, and i now see have tears as i write this that i was in a self induced coma for almost years, using alcohol to keep me asleep and compliant. and above all, to keep this beast on a leash. i was talking to my sister, and i said i used to tell a story of how i was angry, every minute of every day, at age . then there is this fog, this blank in my memory of what happened next. i tell the story that i grew out of it because in my memory, there is no other explanation. now i see that i did not grow out of it. i covered it up with drinking. for years. that is so tremendously sad to me. it hurts writing that. the rage and the hurt at some of the thing that happened in my life were always there. waiting. manifesting in fears, manifesting in self destructive choices. manifesting in numbness. i used to make this terribly sad, i see now joke i am just going to go home and knock myself over the head with a wine bottle. if i had a tough day or was covering up emotions. i guess i am just here today to get support and stories about how others managed their graveyards when all the undead starting coming to life. i told my bf it is like a sea dried up. and there is all these skeletons and shipwrecks. there is treasure. but i have to deal with all the wreckage first. it is a lot. thank you for being here.",alcoholism

-16.27918,9.50751,"staring into the abyss, but not quite there and some things i have learned i should probably state right off that i am not on the heavy drinker side and i do not think my problem compares to some of the more serious posts duis, marital violence, etc . but i will just throw in my story and see what comes of it since this has become a bit of a small demon i have been wrestling with, and i have figured out some tools and meds early on that work for me. i am a year old guy. interestingly i almost never drank up until age , then started enjoying some beers on the weekend. by my late s with more and more stress going on it was up to beers nightly. after a few years i started noticing alcohol switched over diametrically from being euphoric and giving me energy to making me relaxed, and at the highest doses, sleepy. i do not understand this, but it is what it is. which sucks at social gatherings, so as much as i want to share in drinking, i have to keep it to light drinking so i can stay engaged. since then i have been pretty steady at drinks a night, but since beer tends to give me gas and the runs in the morning i switched over to vodka in recent months good old sobieski or tvarscki and all that stopped. i normally do shots of this during my late evening time, spread over hours. the alcohol makes it easy to get to sleep and i always hydrate well so i only get a weak hangover, but one way or the other i always wake up earlier than usual, so i am averaging hours a night of probably what is not great sleep. i think i have managed to be very disciplined given the circumstances. i have only blacked out once in my life at home , have never driven under the influence, i never drink before pm usually i stay occupied and that pushes it back to after pm , and i have kept it from actually impacting my outside life, even though i know i am not at my best. but it is regular, almost daily drinking. i work at home and set my own hours, and while i am happy and sober then, my real challenge is being at home after work and alone right now as i get bored and alcohol does give that short term shot of feeling better. my motivations to stop i have been well aware for a long time that drinking is going to put me in the grave sooner than i want. a wake up call was this summer when my normal blood pressure started trending upward gradually to . it is back to normal with metoprolol, but that is just a band aid. one positive thing if i have gone a day without alcohol which does happen i definitely notice a real pick up in energy and mental clarity. that right there is some motivation that pulls me out of this rather than pushes me. there are some other reasons to stop, like wanting to be a better husband and not half present in the evening. i wo not get into that but my wife and i had some issues in our marriage before i got into the drinking, and we love each other but we are still on a rocky road. medications... i have been on some different medications to treat just the anxiety. for about years i have taken pregabalin lyrica mg as needed, which is very similar to gabapentin but is more expensive and has more of an euphoric effect. i noticed pretty quickly that it does shut down a lot of the alcohol cravings above mg. this month i started trying gabapentin mg, and it seems to me to be even more effective at this. i am still comparing and contrasting the two as they are close cousins of one another, but it seems gabapentin delivers some of the mellow, foggy side of the alcohol experience with a bit of a tendency for me to fall into thinking holes where i get overly focused on something, which can be a good thing while pregabalin is a slightly euphoric foggy version with less of the mellow and the mellow does kind of need to be there . if i ride with it, even though i am bored i might think about the alcohol but but also be okay with just vegging out and doing something low key or going to bed, which i think is the right tack. i am finding that this fails if i do not sequence the meds correctly before the evening habits anxiety cravings kick in. if i do not do this, then i am kind of miserable all night, and i can either suck it up or take the easy road and have a few drinks. i have been careful to never combine combine meds alcohol, and that is been helpful for not even getting the idea of having a drink or two to help it along. so i am trying one pill at pm to curb the initial cravings, and overlaying that with another pill around pm so that there is a strong overlap at midnight. when i do that, it seems my desire to drink in the evening is gone. i also have some diazepam available for breakthrough, but like i said meds do not work well for me if anxiety is already surfacing. they seem to be best used early in the evening for shoring myself up on evenings where i am stressed about something. diazepam seems to last a good hours, so it is an ace card. i am not sure that any other meds help, though i strongly suspect tyrosine helps me feel more functional overall during the day. my new beta blockers might help, too, but i am undecided yet what their anxiolytic effects are so i have been just taking them before bed so i sleep soundly as the evening meds wear off. habits... a lot hinges on what i do in the evenings, which are by myself right now as my wife and i are temporarily separated as she is working on some family related issues in another state. i enjoy video gaming and with only a couple of mistakes i have been very careful not to drink while gaming, as i realized early on that associating alcohol with activities is probably an irreversible thing. sometimes i enjoy just doing more business work. so i am always having to think ahead to make sure i do not walk into the kitchen bored and start thinking about cracking open the bottle. and the things said in what i did tonight instead.. about grooming resonated with me. i noticed a bit of a change almost instantly as a guy after a good haircut, brushing my teeth, and shaving... it made me feel different, and i think that helped me reconnect with old thought patterns from my s when i was content and never drank. paradoxically i have noticed that my anxiety cravings are worse when there is no alcohol in the house than when i have got a bottle around. i ca not quite figure this out. i guess that is more of a security thing knowing it is around, and i can avoid it just keeping it in the cabinet. so that is where i am at. because of the liquor cabinet paradox, i will not worry about whether i am doing moderation or abstinence and just take it a day at a time and start fresh the next day. i guess in a way i am just worrying about the path and not stressing over where the mountain goes.",alcoholism

-17.263931,14.509674,"thoughts after months so after several attempts to quit myself, coming clean to my family friends gf about my drinking l almost but not always daily for about years, and periodically before that, i made the change to stop. i would like to share a few things with you. first i would like to say not everyone is problems are the same, but just because someone else is are worse better does not make them any worse better than you. step tell someone i told my family, my closest friends, and my lovely girlfriend. it was hard. just do it, so you can start moving forward. preferably before you alienate yourself from them, or before they find out as a criminal repercussion. step read r stopdrinking the first thing i did was lurk here at night, if my gf was out or out of town. reading the stories helps, even if i was drinking while i was doing it. i was moody and irritable for a while. i got anxious about many things, especially feelings of loss, inadequacy, or jealousy. step alan carr and craig beck the second thing i did was read alan carr and craig beck. while both books make sense logically, it is still hard when you are in the haze to rationally know you are ingesting a poison, no matter how much it is marketed to be a whimsical drink. i would suggest to read them, and keep reading them if possible. i do not think they are the end all be all product that the authors make them out to be. each person is going to have to find out why they drink, and why they want to stop. for some people they drink because of anxiety, or add, or chemical imbalance, depression, stress. all of those are going to have different approaches that will generally make cessation of alcohol consumption easier. if you can address the issues, and realize why you are flooding your brain with dopamine, you can stop, especially for some that have an undiagnosed brain chemistry issue. for some people, they are just plain addicted to ethanol, and it might never ever stop even after years of sobriety. step smart recovery i decided to attend smart first. i go to one a week, and the people there are generally very good, very different. a couple of internet addicts, a couple of narc addicts long time abstinent, but mostly alcohol users abusers. normal people, some clean a long time, some clean only mo yr. soccer moms and it admins. smart is not like aa more on that later. it is still about realizing you are not alone, you are not broken, and others are like you. it is definitely about finding your reason for drinking, facing it, and dealing with your thoughts. training your brain to create new neural pathways, return your dopamine to normal functioning, and resist the triggers and behaviors that you have ingrained for so long. their website has quite a bit of information you can use. the classes are free, but they do allow donations, and sell a workbook for . for me, the class was less about me being an alcoholic, and more about understanding why my brain functions on alcohol, and not normally. i am possibly going to get on add medication in the next few months, but i would like to see how i feel at and days first. i plan to continue smart once a week for a while, until i do not think i can get anymore out of it. step outpatient therapy and aa after a couple of weeks, and after consulting with my family and gf, i decided to enter a pretty intensive outpatient program. i received a medical screen. liver was surprisingly fine, blood pressure is high. all other vitals were impeccable, which is not surprising considering i worked out almost days a week for the better part of years. doctors were surprised, but that is one thing i would do is supplement well, have great nutrition, and exercise, even when drunk. all functioning should return to normal with months to a year. my one recommendation whether you are at toxic levels or just drinking more than you want, is to get your nutrition right immediately. magnesium and zinc, vitamin c, b complexes, especially b , dhea, omega s, and women will probably need iron. eat vegetables, make your own vegetable fruit juice. get healthy fats and proteins, and try to limit carbs and sugars if possible, although no need to eliminate them completely. the first thing you need to do when you quit is start an exercise and nutrition regime. take that a week you were spending and go buy a gym membership and a month of personal training. i met with a counselor, which was... pretty lame actually. i did not connect with her at all... but whatever. this program is highly recommended but apparently it is the one the state uses for offenders. at every level of orientation and admission they were completely surprised i was not there by court order, but of my own volition because i want to get back to where i was. apparently most of the voluntary admissions do a day inpatient, and i ca not miss work two jobs. the outpatient is days a week, hours a day, which is tough, but i am really wanting to do this. the first two days are individual small group therapy. i got a lot of literature. i know why i drink, and why i can only feel emotion when i drink. i do not release dopamine normally anymore, and i get anxious when i am not drinking, or when something sets me off, so i rush to the booze to feel normal again. it is good to be cognizant of these facts so that i can realize i do not even like drinking, i never really did. i just used it to medicate myself. it will be possible i might see a therapist and psychiatrist in the next few months to address that, we will see. the third day is large group aa. and it sucks. a group of , all men, about offenders, drug addicts, and people on forced classes for probation. i suppose they do this to let the voluntary admissions see what they could be like? a couple like me with no legal issues, a couple first time dui is, and then some seriously messed up individuals. homeless, criminal, some you could tell were in bad shape, and others who you knew were drunk and did not care, or were about to go drink again. people you did not want to end up like. the aa portion is all about god, and they are hardcore. i am not a fan. i do not really get anything out of the wednesday portion, but like i said, i am committed, and it is definitely eye opening to see what i could be like if i continue this path. also, to anyone reading, just because i did not have major legal problems and you might have, does not mean i am better than you. i will not be continuing with aa after this. i do not feel anything from it. what i have learned about myself, lost, and gained i have learned i need to find ways to deal with long deep seated problems. the loss of my sister and grandfather. my parents divorce. both of my parents addictions. i grew up in a fucked up household and i do not know what normality is. i thrive on drama and dysfunction, despite having degrees and certifications and jobs and a relationship. i probably need some sort of cbt, and possibly some add medication, but i will move forward with that when i have been clean about months. i have had no legal problems from my drinking. shamefully, i passed two field sobriety tests in the past years. i do not know how. i rarely drove drunk, and for the past year i was drinking at home only, never socially. what i did do was alienate myself. i would drink, get depressed about it, and drink more. when i was sober i would get angry, so i would drink to be happy. i would drink to go to work, to workout, to spend an evening with my girlfriend. what i did do was spend probably k over years. i could have already finished grad school and paid it off with that time and money. we could have a house and a downpayment. i ca not look back, but i need to realize what this costs me in the future if i keep going. it has costs me professional and personal development, as well as friendships and missing out on family members. what i have gained is an understanding of why i was doing what i was doing. i am not saying why i drank is why you drink, but when i understood why i did it, it really clicked in my head. yea a buzz is fine, but i went almost years with no alcohol and loved life. i went another just drinking socially. it is when life turned bad and my coping behaviors and mechanisms were not established, that i turned to ethanol as a medication. now that i know that, i can see it for what it is, and change it. for me i truly feel it is a physical chemical issue in the brain, that i can truly fix, along with having preventative behaviors in place. i do not need alcohol, just like i do not need to pop xanax. neither one is going to do anything for me. i have also gained a future again. i want to get married in a year. i want a house and a family with my girlfriend. i am going to finish grad school. my family is back... well they never left, i just left them. all it took was just saying i had a problem and i needed help. the final thing i gained was an understanding that i was not broken, and i was not weak. as a man, and as many men understand, if you admit weakness you are often seen as a failure, less of a man, or not one at all. hiding this was killing me, because i felt if anyone found out they would abandon me. quite the contrary, i received nothing but support, and they think i am extremely strong to attack this. so that is my experiences of the last months. i have got another weeks of outpatient. i am not sure it helped more than any of the other pieces of the puzzle, but i definitely have a better picture of what my future will be like if i do not get a hang on ways to deal with stress, anxiety, and pain. many of these people will be locked up again, broke, on the streets, with no one to care for them. do not be like them. aa did nothing for me, but if it helps you then fine. smart was very valuable, as were carr and beck is books. exercising and eating right were always there, but it is nice to not have to down cups of coffee in the morning, or have jitters with lbs on your back, or having your police gym buddy laughingly asking how much you drank last night because he can smell it when you really just downed a . ml before you came in... i will not attend aa after this. i will still go to smart for months. i plan on seeing a psych therapist. i plan on staying around here but not a whole lot. honestly, i just want to get away from alcohol. i never needed it before, and i do not need it now. my gf has maybe a glass of wine once a month, and she is got bottles of crown her dad gave her as a gift in our living room, that she wo not ever drink. i have not even had the urge to touch them, and it does not bother me if she wants a glass. that is all i have got for now. i realize were all different. we have different labels. i do not like the term alcoholic. i honestly think most people use it as medication, although many can just be addicts. i think the issue is much more multifaceted than that. the common thread is that we want to stop doing this harmful behavior, and move forward to a life we think we deserve. good luck everyone and thanks for listening.",alcoholism

8.956472,-10.312254,"do i have social anxiety or perhaps something else? sorry long post perhaps you guys could help me. i just don t feel right. psychologically i feel like i lack a lot of what makes a person normal. i ve felt this way for years, and always assumed i was just shy but the past few years i get the feeling like it is something more than that. be it because of adhd or social anxiety disorder sad or perhaps both, i just can t seem to function. some backstory i guess into why i feel i have either add or sad. well the thing is i don t feel like it manifested itself until high school. in elementary and middle school i ve always had friends and iirc i was happy. high school, all my friends went to one high school and i went to another so i was alone. i barely remember freshmen and sophomore year but i was definitely alone at lunch a lot. eventually i met a group of people who kinda let me into their group but i was never a friend or anything. i was just on the outskirts. most of them probably were wondering who the hell i was since i only knew like of them. i really didn t find a group i meshed well with until senior year but even then i was still on the outside looking in. i played a sport in high school and got to know people but thinking back on it now, i feel as if i was too much. don t know how to explain it really, i was just an over the top person. maybe cocky and loud when i had no reason in being so. thinking back on it now, i realize how the people i met and hung out with then didn t like me much. now i can hear the condescending tone of their compliments when back then i was just happy i had friends. not to say they were mean people either, i think i my personality was just off putting. it worked well i guess in middle school when everybody was more childish and stuff but it is not what you are supposed to be as you grow older. never matured with the years. blah blah blah so yeah after graduation i got into a good university and i was excited for change, except things changed for the worse. i should have expected it though. in my years at the university i didn t make one friend. and that s not an exaggeration either. first year i ate alone every night. i had roommates but one was never there and another nobody really liked. i fuckin hated the guy. i participated in the dorm floor events but still never really clicked with people. i remember how pathetic i was, i would bump my music really loud with the door open just hoping someone would come by and be like oh you listing to , you are so cool. let s chill! my grades were beginning to fall pretty bad, and i was not taking classes i needed either. i think life would have been better if i had taken classes pertaining a major in general. i hadn t the slightest clue about what i wanted to be but i should have taking courses pointed in a general direction. that way i would have classes with dorm mates and get to know people better. unfortunately i just took a bunch of random intro classes and shit that don t allow for much interaction. by the end of my first year my i was consistently missing classes and just completely failing courses. i got put on academic probation and for the next years i went back and forth between community college and the university. finally i decided i needed to move back home and get my life back together. again i feel like things turned for the worse. things were pretty bad at the university, with no friends and such, but being back home just amplified things tenfold. at least at the university i had a few people i knew that i had known since high school. back home, there is nobody, and no opportunities either. i think this may be my second year back and just last spring semester do really feel like i m starting to do things properly in terms of education. taking necessary courses and stuff. years removed from high school and i m no closer to graduating than the day i finished high school. i still have no friends and no hobbies. just plain nothingness. i just seem wholly apathetic to everything in the world. i picked up a job and met a few good people but i eventually self destructed and totally quit. i seem to do that a lot too. anytime people get sort of close i begin to get uncomfortable, like maybe they won t like me when they learn more and more about who i am. i get reclusive and push away. i just seem to get angry at people when i see them living their lives. i don t want to make this longer than it already is but i really feel like i m glossing over all the important parts that explain my inability to stay attentive or make friends. i don t know what i m asking, an affirmation that i need help? i just want to know if indeed i am afflicted by add or sad. i haz sad . i just don t feel like i belong in this world and i m totally self conscious. i gave more of a history lesson than an explanation of why i feel the way i do perhaps you guys could help me understand myself. i ve read both the add and sad subreddits and a lot of what people say seem to apply to me. i want to get an appointment but i ve been putting it off for no good reason. at times i just don t feel like i have a problem and should just go out and try to be social. maybe i m afraid that i will find out that i do not have an issues and i m just a fucked up person or that i won t be able to explain my situation clearly. the stories i ve read on the subreddits seem to make my case weaker and scare me off from making an appointment. advice? perhaps i should just man the fuck up. really sorry for the long ass post. don t know how to tl dr this but here is the general ish cannot concentrate at all and never feel like doing anything. just sit on my ass all day have maybe friends though i like to refer to them as one level past acquaintances. zero ability to make new ones originally i posted this to r askreddit but i know some people that also read reddit so i moved it here. thats why i was also asking about add",anxiety

8.72228,10.73386,"so i bit the bullet and finally went to the doctor for my anxiety... for the last four months i have noticed the deterioration of my mental health. especially in the last three months, where my health anxiety has reached a new level of extreme i am convinced all these symptoms are due to a brain tumour . adding to that, i have been ridiculously irritable, i am sensitive to noise and easily startled, i constantly feel like i have been on the edges of a panic attack, i feel doomed, sad, and feel like i am no longer able to live a normal life. the worst part of this is that i have developed a fear of going insane, that i will develop schizophrenia or bipolar or some form of mood disorder. i check the symptoms daily convinced that i am suffering from one thing or another. this level of my anxiety worried me. i knew that it was not okay, and to be honest i was sick of feeling this way. so i went to the website of my country is mental health organisation and i did their checklist. it told me that it detected high levels of anxiety and depression, and that i was to go and see my gp. so i did. in fact, i went twice. the first time i was told that i had a middle inner ear infection i do have ear issues due to my jaw and was referred to an ent. the doctor said that it was probably the infection that was causing me to feel this anxious and irritable. ok. so i went to the ent, he was great. but i did not have an infection. by further examining my jaw and the amount of dysfunction he saw there it was impacting the ear nerves he determined that all my symptoms were from stress. great. but i was still scared, still anxious. some nights i went to bed, thinking that it would not be bad to just fall asleep and not wake up in the morning. i hate that i have even had to type such a sentence, but i can assure you that i am not suicidal, that i simply feel resigned and hopeless . needless to say, this scared the shit out of me. i would find myself to feel okay and normal again, especially when i was busy or surrounded by friends, but give it a couple of hours and my moods would turn again. so i went to the doctor, again. this time i was told that i should practice breathing deeply and calmly. that feeling anxious was normal, that i was going through life changes and that stress was a natural byproduct. and so here i am. i feel completely dejected. i have poured my heart out two different doctors and was turned away without much help. i have had a nervous breakdown before i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was two years old, and having been sexually molested as a teen did not really help things . but i want to get better, i am and i want to join the rest of the folk and feel healthy again. i want to feel this weight off my shoulders and to finally feel normal . i just do not know how to go about it anymore, whether it is even bloody possible s sorry for this rant. i will probably wake up in the morning and be embarrassed by this rant and moment of weakness. thanks for listening though i already feel a little better having written my thoughts down.",anxiety

two weeks. whether i receive my degree is still in the air. there was a point in this semester where i was so stressed, so socially withdrawn, that i stopped going to a couple of my classes. one was a public speaking class required core that i waited years to take , another is a class in my major. after a few weeks i realized that i could not do this anymore i needed to get some help. i went to a counselor a psychologist, who officially diagnosed me with what i suspected i had for a very long time social anxiety. the stress of public speaking this other class largely discussion based instead of lectures, that killed me pushed me into shutdown mode i stopped going to them. the other classes i had were fine i enjoy lectures that allow you to ask questions when needed, not really a forced interaction by public speaking such. of course, my counselor suggested strongly that i try to alleviate the time missed talk to my professors about my condition what could be done to salvage the time i lost. my public speaking professor was beyond helpful, i will more than likely pass the class with an a i honestly expected a c, but i worked hard on those speeches . however. the class in my major is giving me trouble. this particular professor i emailed at the same time i emailed my public speaking teacher. i explained why i skipped her class since most of her assignments were placed online, i was treating it as an online course. she seemed keyword cool with it, wanted to meet. i wanted to set up office hours she is impossible to catch she is only on campus like two days a week less if she ends up cancelling class, which was often she barely replies to my emails about assignment matters...she does not have an actual office, either, that i know of . she wanted to meet with me after a class period but i told her that i could not make that time asked if she could set up a different time in a private setting her office, wherever it may be i still do not know . i never got a response. so i am like...okay, kind of typical with her. i will keep doing the work. fast forward to one week before finals. on the syllabus, it states that our final will be provided online like our midterm was. however, she sent out this email talking about if we do this extra social work type event, we do not have to show up for the final. obviously i have not been back to class so i do not know what is going on. i sent an email inquiring about the change in the final. no answer. i send a second email. all hell breaks loose. she replies the quickest i have ever had a reply from her like less than an hour after i sent it it was the rudest reply ever. she basically said well if you were in class you would know. okay... i reply back that her curt response was unwarranted. she goes on to tell me how rude disrespectful i was for demanding information about the final. i sent a polite email no more than two sentences asking for clarification of the final. that was it. she unleashes this wall of text, of course, since i replied saying that i attempted to contact her about my absences telling her that i resolved the issue with one professor while she never responded after i told her i could not meet at her designated time. she then demanded that i become humble restart the conversation about the final or basically she has a right to fail me. regardless of my absences, i feel that her initial response meant that she understood would work with me. she did not drop me from the class, either. she makes it seem like i made no attempt to contact her that i am asking for special treatment. granted, i should have started going back to class when i emailed her. but it just felt awkward weird i did not want to just suddenly show up one day like nothing happened. i wanted to reintroduce myself as i did for my public speaking class. talk to the professor, get an understanding, work on things from there. now i feel like i should have just randomly shown up again although i believe she is more upset because she initially misinterpreted the tone in my email, then expected me to return her rude tone with a nice email. that is just not how i work i was not mean about it i phrased my words firmly, but there was no blatant disrespect or even personal attacks . i am not going to grovel for a grade for work that i have completed, minus the final. i have not made a failing grade in any assignment in her class yet. now she is withholding information about the final essentially waving her final grade in the air until i apologize, i guess. i have considered bringing this up to my advisor, who is also the department head. i literally only have a couple of days left in the semester, with the following week reserved for said finals. it would really annoy me to have to come back take one class just to get my degree especially in a class whose subject i enjoyed otherwise. i also hate that i put in the work may ultimately have my gpa messed up, anyway. so, that is my story. i am just beyond stressed. x x i am just wondering what i should do. i do know i was wrong for disappearing but i tried to alleviate the situation way before now. our personalities seem to clash, too. it is like she is taking offense to a tone that was not there initially, as well as taking it personally that i did not go to class when it was not her, just the format. i again asked for her office hours location so we could meet to discuss. no answer. again. what would you do? have you ever skipped a class because of social anxiety depression stress?",anxiety

17.399271,24.28934,"how i beat anxiety, and how you can too. two years ago i did the impossible. at least it seemed impossible in my mind. two years ago today i competed in my first big ju jitsu tournament in nashville tennessee and won first place in my division. if you do not know what ju jitsu is, it is a martial art. similar to wrestling only the end goal is to force your opponent to tap out. either by putting them in some sort of choke, or putting stress on a joint. after that day i knew i had put my anxiety in the rear view. i started training in martial arts as an escape. to get away from school or anything else that stressed me out that day. i did not even want to compete. i just wanted to work out which is a great way to get your mind off things, highly recommended . before i had this escape i was a nervous wreck all the time. my anxiety caused me to stop playing sports, and for some reason i was deathly afraid to go to school. you should probably know this all started when i was in fourth grade. that is when anxiety sucker punched my year old face. in fourth grade, in the morning i would run to the bathroom and have panic attacks in the stall. once i felt confident enough i would go to the school counselor. i would talk to her and try to calm down, but i would not even enter the classroom until o clock most days. this went on until i started talking to an actual counselor. i owe her everything. i was her youngest client, but she still worked with me. this is where people in this sub confuse me. you say your afraid to talk to someone about it. this is one of my biggest pet peeves too. people claim they have anxiety, but they are not really officially diagnosed because they refuse to get help. that is like a medical student saying they are a doctor before they graduate. i may be wrong for me to say that, but that is how i feel. anyway, she helped me gain enough confidence to go to school like any normal kid. so step talk to somebody. for me, talking to somebody was great it helped a lot, but not enough. i was still a nervous wreck all the time. this is when i started taking medicine. celexa i think it is called. now antidepressants are good they help a lot of people, but if you want to do what i did, you need to make your make it your main goal to handle your anxiety by yourself. so use medicine as a tool, and not as a crutch. this is one of the things my counselor told me before i was using it. so this is shit is some professional advice. step use medicine as a tool, not a crutch i took medicine, and it helped me train myself to handle nervousness on my own. but i still would nearly have an attack over the stupidest things. for example, this was in fifth grade. i was looking at books because i needed a new ar book. i do not know about you guys, but for me i like to take my time and find a book i am going to like. so i was in front of the bookshelf for about ten minutes and counting when the teacher said, cole, you have minutes to find a book and sit down. now this triggered something in my brain to go into panic mode. i went to the school counselor and explained why i was so worked up. after i explained myself i realized how stupid this was, and laughed about it with her. stuff like this went on for about a year until i found my escape. this is the third step, find an escape. for me this escape was martial arts. i know, why would you want your escape to be getting beat up? and the answer is i have no idea. now your escape does not have to be this or even working out. it can be anything that gets your mind concentrated on something else. it can be drawing, video games, reading, whatever. just something that gets your mind in extreme focus mode. step find your escape now this last step might take a long time to achieve. for me it took about years, and it has to do with me doing the impossible. so martial arts being my escape, i did not want it to be a place that created stress. it turned out that that was exactly what i needed. to get out of my comfort zone. the ju jitsu tournament i went to is called naga north american grappling association . yes, i am aware it sounds like the n word. i did not pick the name. it was in nashville so lots of people came. crowds are not one of my triggers, but holy shit this crowd was a trigger. i did not have an attack because i trained myself to subside it, but i was really close the whole time leading up to my match. it turned out that there was only three people in my division so the most i would have to fight was twice. of course my division is called to our section of that mat, and i am in the first match. i look at the video now, and it does not even look like me. i was a totally different person. the match probably lasted only a minute. i was so filled with adredaline that i was able to get a choke in and nearly make him pass out. let me tell you, the ref raising my arm up. looking at all the people that were there to support me. it was the best natural high i have ever felt in my life. i spent the rest of the day just thinking how far i came from fourth grade crying in the bathroom to now. i did this to prove to myself that i could beat my anxiety, and i did. only having one moment of triumph was not enough for me. so i decided to play football my freshman year of highschool. football was what i did before my anxiety blew up. so getting back into that was something i also needed to prove to myself i could do. we had a freshman team so we never dressed varsity, but for me it was still gut wrenching. i remember the first day of full pads i had that same feeling i had before the tournament. i was a different person again. i just strapped on my pads when one of my teammates asked, dude you okay? i said, yeah just a little nervous. when he said this it changed my perspective for the rest of the season, do not be nervous, you are like one of the biggest guy on the team. you will be fine. this was true and i did not even realize it. as a freshman i was about and about . somehow i worked my way up to starting defensive end. it was the second to last game and i fucked up my knee bad. had to have surgery because of it. my worst fear came true, but it was not even that bad. after that i decided football was not for me, but i did it. i proved to myself that i could once again. it took tons of hard work, that is why i get so mad when people claim they have anxiety when in reality they do not. they just do not know what it is really like. they do not know what it is like to have to put in so much work to function like a normal human being. so the last and most important step. step get out of your comfort zone, and prove to yourself that you can beat it . i need to point out that my anxiety is still here. it does not go away completely. i just recognize when i am having irrational thoughts, and i can convince myself that what i am telling myself is nonsense. everybody is different when it comes to anxiety, so the way i did it is not for everybody. sometimes you just have to find your own way. i understand that some people have had anxiety worse than me, but it was still a challenge for me to overcome. this felt great to write. looking back and see how far i have come again. i want this to help people. that is why i visit this sub and comment when i feel i can give advice. anyone looking to talk to someone you can talk to me. pm me on reddit and i will give the best words of wisdom i can. thanks for reading guys. i hope you can take something from this, and start your success story. edit damn i have noticed that this has been nearly downvoted . i would love to hear why someone might not like my advice. everything i have said to do is just my philosophy based on my experience and what has worked for me. that does not mean theses steps will work for everybody.",anxiety

8.729723,2.048243,"thank you, r anxiety! you gave me the confidence to go to a concert alone in a huge city, and it was absolutely incredible. the other day, i posted on here about how scared i was to go to a demi lovato concert i won tickets for in a sweepstakes. none of my friends could go, and i was extremely frightened by the prospect of going there by myself. i have never been to a big city before, and it took a lot of encouragement and positive self talk before i finally convinced myself that it would be the right decision. i almost talked myself out of it when my parents offered to let me stay with them for the weekend as an alternative to being lonely up in kansas city, as they put it. after i posted about my dilemma to r anxiety, the positive feedback i received was enough to make me reconsider the concert again, and i decided to drive up there yesterday. driving in the city was scary at first, but i managed to stay calm by listening very closely to the gps and focusing on the road ahead. once i got to the hotel, everything went off without a hitch. i checked into my room first time i have done that by myself and i got my stuff ready for the concert. i managed to get a fantastic parking spot at the very front of the venue by going there hours in advance, and i picked up my free tickets at the box office to think that my parents had told me that the tickets i won were just a scam ! i bought a demi t shirt and i fucking rocked it! the majority of the audience members were girls, and some of them probably assumed i was gay, but honestly? i did not care anymore! i made it all the way to this concert by myself . i never in a million years thought i could do that! a wave of anxiety hit me right before the concert as a bunch of teenagers flowed in behind me. they were gossiping about celebrity drama, taking selfies, and snapchatting which reminded me of the types of girls in my old high school who would not give me the time of day. i got really quiet and anxious for about minutes, worried that i would not be able to enjoy the concert as much as i thought. but when demi hit the stage... i freaked out . in a good way! everyone around me was screaming at the top of their lungs, and i joined in, relieved that any negative attention directed at me was dispelled by the sheer enthusiasm and noise. i even found myself dancing. dancing! knowing all the songs and most of the lyrics was an absolutely incredible feeling since i could easily got lost in the music, and, for the first time in a long time, i was actually enjoying myself in a sincere, anxiety free way. this experience was proof to me that i am capable of anything if i put my mind to it. my anxiety does not control me, and i can put it aside if i need to. and that is something i never thought i could ever say. thank you so much for giving me that last essential push of encouragement, r anxiety. you guys are the best.",anxiety

i started treating myself for seasonal depression. the winter being as gray, gloomy and yucky as it was, i was sure this was it. i took magnesium and vitamin d, started exercising more, sitting by a uv light i bought, taking myself on walks anything! although, i still felt empty and blah, i thought i was managing and just needing to make it until spring. during this time, my husband and i moved and our family had a lot going on so i was distracted, but still couldn t shake the emptiness. my days were hit or miss days and i was taking things one day at a time. i also was feeling quite guilty knowing this couldn t be easy for my poor husband to deal with. to come home from work and see your new wife still in her pajamas and laying on the couch crying for no reason all i can say is i felt so bad. it s not like i didn t realize i had a happy life, i knew this very well. i had nothing to be sad about and everything to be grateful for, but the more i felt sad, the more sad i got about feeling sad in the first place! it felt like being in a prison and you re only allowed to look out a window and watch everyone else have a good time. finally a sunny day arrived, the first sign of spring. the temperature was forecasted to reach about degrees! i was so excited, made a plan for the day and got myself out of the house to soak up the sun. i started on my errands when a wave of sadness came over me. not being able to hold back my tears, i pulled off into a parking lot where i sat and cried. the frustration was too much, i thought if this is seasonal depression, then why am i still feeling so sad? finding myself back at square one, i was beyond discouraged. by this time it had been going on for months and i had gotten lbs. heavier. i knew i had to go see a doctor. this was the last thing i wanted to do me, taking the initiative to make an appointment to talk to a stranger about how i was feeling? ugh! it was not easy, but i had a feeling, with my situation, that there was something underlying that was causing all this. i found a doctor, made an appointment and went in. we talked, they did some blood work and within a few days i was called in for a follow up. i was diagnosed with chronic hypothyroidism and was prescribed nature thyroid medication. the doctor that treated me was knowledgeable, fast, and arranged for my medication to be mailed to me the best experience i ve ever had at the doctor like ever! finding the right dosage was rocky and my moods went up and down while i worked to get it right. it also was making me nauseous at first the medication is shocking to your system and it s normal to have to ease into it. even just increasing by half a pill can make a big difference. once the dosage was right, i felt a clear, night and day difference. not only did the depression and sadness stop, so did other weird symptoms that i didn t know were correlated. during the months of the depression i felt colder than i had ever been feet, hands, my whole body which played into me staying in bed my periods would start about every weeks and i was on birth control fatigue lowered metabolism unexplained weight gain muscle weakness high cholesterol slowed heart rate excessive sleepiness fatigue irritability mood swings depression symptoms that come along with that! as you can imagine, these factors all play into one another and begin to compound. it starts you in a downward spiral and you truly cannot get yourself out of it. the thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism body temperature, assist your muscles organs in working properly, is essential for every cell in you body. when it s not functioning you are at risk for hypo or hyper thyroidism and when it s not functioning it s a toxic whirlwind of symptoms. but once i was started on the right dose, all of these issues were resolved. the result has been me feeling better now than i did before. interestingly enough hypothyroidism is an autoimmune reaction. my doctor wasn t able to give me an exact reason as to why someone develops it, but i was able to find some risk factors. a few of the risk factors that pertain to me are being a caucasian woman and having celiac disease there are others . celiac disease is also an autoimmune disorder that i ve known i ve had for about years now. if you happen to find yourself in a rut, feeling unexplainably depressed, riding waves of sadness, not being able to move or get yourself going, go see your doctor. it s not easy, but a doctor is the only person who can truly know what s wrong and that has the tools to help. my heart goes out to those who battle chronic depression and anxiety to those who struggle everyday. those who fight everyday to get out of bed, to feel sincere joy, who struggle to combat the dark intense feelings. i only got a glimpse into how it feels and i would not wish it on anyone. i am really thankful my husband was here for me everyday to support me. he held me when i cried, he didn t judge but, he encouraged and protected me, and all with such patience which i think i tested, i don t think he knew he had that much in him . if you are reading this and know someone going through anything similar, i m sure it s hard to know how to help. let me just say this during this time, my mom came to visit one day and brought me a card and something to eat and we just sat on the couch and talked. i cried when she left cause it meant everything it still makes me emotional . it told me that she understood i was struggling. all i wanted was someone to show up and tell me that they cared. it took so much for me to leave the house, so someone coming over was exactly what i needed. so visit, show up, call, and listen, show empathy and compassion even if you don t fully understand it. it s likely that those suffering with depression are hiding it, walking around smiling and saying they are fine. be kind and thoughtful to those around you. if you are noticing a loved one is becoming withdrawn or not acting like themselves, it s probably because they are hurting. be patient. care enough to take the time to say something and not let them suffer alone. pain is a part of life and love, and it helps us grow. it s sad that with pain, often brings feelings of shame, guilt and fear for feeling such a way i do this all the time . it s human to feel sad, depressed and alone, it s not realistic to be happy days out of the year. feeling and facing pain is an art it is through our hard times in which we gain experience. from our new experience we can learn and reach understanding so we can become stronger people and help others in their low times. the moments of joy and happiness that life offers should be cherished those are the moments that can provide us the hope we need, to be carried through our times of difficulty.",depression

9.287179,35.27132,"on being myself i have been getting a lot of mixed signals lately. well, for most of my life. i am supposed to chase my dreams, shoot for the stars, believe in myself, blah blah blah. nobody wants to admit that it is bullshit, but everyone knows it is. we do what we have to do so that we can do what we want to do. that is it. and you know, that is alright. it starts before pre school. we are encouraged to talk, to interact, to participate. but if we do not do it in precisely appropriate ways, we get punished for it. it is okay to draw on a piece of paper, but not a wall. it is excellent to learn how to communicate, but from the very beginning it is not a conversation, it is a lecture. this is how it is. this is who you are. this is who you will be. once these rules are established, we are told by authority figures that self esteem is very important. however, any deviance from the norm is either ridiculed by our peers or seen as a problem by those same authority figures. it is important to be yourself, as long as yourself fits exactly where it is supposed to fit. i spent my entire childhood poking around, trying to figure out the rules and where they were. and the truth is every situation has it is own rules. there is no universally right, no universally wrong. math is easy because the rules are clear if you understand the rules, you know how to do whatever assignment is thrown at you. everything else is adaptation to the current situation. what is right in a game of tag is not right at a funeral, or in a class, or a grocery store. all of these places and events have their own rules. hell, the rules even change depending on the people involved. we are taught what to think rather than how to think. when i started treatment, it felt like brainwash. still does. because in the beginning, i did not want to die, i would not even say i was depressed. i just felt trapped. i felt like i did not fit, and there was no option to explore, to find a place where i would fit. instead, my teen years were an exercise in mashing a square peg through a round hole. be yourself but be the self we want you to be it reached a point where i was willing to die to escape. all i actually had to do was leave, and things got better. every time i would go visit my parents, the ugly beast would rear it is head again. they worried about me, and in their concern, took control. perhaps i am just looking for something other than myself to blame, but i think i have spent long enough guilt ridden and suicidal. i would rather be delusional, i would rather create a false reality in which my fucked up life is someone else is fault than be who they want me to be. now, my stubborn refusal to accept responsibility for my condition does not mean i can refuse to accept responsibility for the solution. i tried suicide, drugs, religion, women, etc. i tried so very hard. turns out all i had to do was actually be myself. if i do not want to go outside, that is okay. no point making myself feel guilty for not feeling like going outside. i have started doing things i want to do, because i want to do them. if going outside is genuinely going to enrich my life, i do it. if not, i do not. i guess this is chasing my dreams . my dream is to work part time and play guitar and video games. and it is wonderful. i do not even feel compelled to do drugs. i still use occasionally, but it is not the grueling desperation that it used to be. now, drugs are a reward rather than a crutch. for a long time now, my motto has been do whatever is necessary to survive . anything is healthier than suicide. so if i had to eat an entire pie, or get wicked high, or self harm, or whatever, i did it. i stopped making myself feel guilty for it, because i understood why i was doing it. sometimes, making it through the next five minutes is a near impossible task. so i did it five minutes at a time, whatever shitty things i had to do to make it. so i guess, if you are going to believe in anything, believe in who you want to be. not who mom and dad expect you to be, not who society expects you to be, not who your friends expect you to be. just you. take some time, it is not like you have to figure it out in the next month, or even the next century. do not worry about making the universe a better place for everyone else, worry about making it the kind of place that you actually feel like hanging out in. it does not have to be glamorous. you do not need to be angelina jolie or bill gates or anything. just do what you have to do so you can do what you want to do. it is not going to last forever, so do not fret if you fuck it up. shit, i actively drove my life into the ground, and i am still here. i doubt i will ever really get my shit together, but for now, i have got a job, an apartment, and an internet connection. that will do, pig. that will do.",depression

do you just sit around and think? to a stoned kid i was introduced to at a college party asking what are you, retarded? when i told him about the weird food concoctions i eat when i am high. i obsess over these things. in addition to proving my own awkwardness and strangeness to me by thrusting me into more social interactions, college has also exposed me to weed. i did not smoke much before this year, but last fall i was up to or times a week. weed augments my consciousness in a way i feel is both useful and damaging. it makes me think more clearly and in a more focused way, but it also seems to increase the effects of whatever disorder real or imagined i am in possession of. i am starting to see that, even though i kind of enjoy being able to think faster, having more thoughts in my head probably is not a great thing. wow, i am sorry for making this so long. if you read all of that, you are a saint, and i am sincerely grateful. i guess my main point is from what i have said, in addition to anything you can gather from my style of writing, what advice can you give me? typing all of this out has made me realize i need to open up more with counselors doctors, so at least there is one thing i can take away from this. i am not really expecting any diagnoses, but if you want to take a poke i would be happy to hear what you think. thanks again for reading. edit format",depression

18.46731,5.7075396,"i finally broke down and acknowledged my depression hi all, year ago today i lost my brother of years to suicide. he was also very much into heavy drug use and partying, and i think his lifestyle just caught up to him. when i found out, my family and i went down a deep spiral and are still recovering to this day. having come to today being the first anniversary, i am back into that grief and depression stage again. i mean, i always have, but i feel it more now than usual for obvious reasons. during the last year, i have also missed countless days at work due to an ongoing medical condition i was born with. i was missing a good half of my work where i normally work full time hours per week and this lasted for months during this year where my condition just peaked to its worst it has been since i was diagnosed. within the last month, i have been able to see a new doctor and get a new treatment that gives me massive quality of life back. i have been getting back to work full time. i am planning to go back to school for my degree next month, and everything is looking well. i live with my parents and i am years old. my mom is also disabled due to a work related injury over years ago and i stay i home to help her live her life instead of moving out. she in turn gives me a break in rent and a great place to stay and i get along fantastically with my parents. we moved to where we are now over years ago for her health because the warmer climate gives her much more energy, also making it easier to move in the warmer climate vs a colder one. when we did back then, i was in between my junior and senior year in high school and coming here, i had no one i knew. and i still do not. ever since we moved, i have been alone except for my parents. i have one friend, my best friend, from my childhood that i keep in touch with but i really have not connected with many people here since the move over years ago. my life is just work, come home and do random stuff in my room, help my parents around the house, and repeat. and it has gotten so monotonous that i am just feeling like i am stuck. as mentioned before i am going back to school. it has been awhile since i have pursued my degree but i took the plunge again into it because my work offers a fully paid tuition towards select schools so it is a great opportunity. but i also did it because i want to take a step forward in life and try to do something to break myself out of this depressing cycle i have gotten myself into. i, for the longest time, refused to acknowledge any sort of depression. and, no offense to anyone here, but it is embarrassing for me to say that i am, especially to others. i feel like if i do, i am defeated, or i have a problem, or i am broken . after my brother passed away last year, i spent a good months seeing a psychiatrist who prescribed me antidepressants that did not help me at all. i got free therapy which did not help either. all this was another reason i did not feel like i was depressed in a medically accurate sense. but i still feel off. and that is only worsened now that i think back to the day i lost my brother and found out. i will never forget it. i am at work right now and i have just been in a very foul mood. when the depression wave hits me, it hits hard. i get angry at everyone and everything. i just want to go back to my room and not deal with anyone, not even my parents whom i have a great relationship with and adore. i lose motivation to do everything that normally love to do in my spare time, and honestly, i have not had motivation to do anything at all lately regardless of feeling like i am going through a phase or not. and my sleep schedule is royally messed up to where i can sleep at days at a time or stay up days at a time because i do not feel like sleeping, causing me to miss work due to lack of energy after. but it all hit my like a truck today. just earlier, when i was just moody, sitting at my desk not wanting to speak with anyone i work in a call center for context , a fellow coworker that i have known for a few years now texted me to come by her desk to get some homemade soup she brought in for her team. so i did. and it tasted so good. this was a person that i have known for awhile and we both share similar hobbies and interests outside of work. she knows what i go through personally outside of work since i have confided in her after, one of the few people i have, about how my life is outside of work. she has been super supportive of everything i am going through. her having reached out, just to offer me soup and tasting how good it was, made me realize just how broken i actually am and how much i have been avoiding it until now. it was not so much just that she offered me good food, but it was that she just thought of me and reached out, despite her not knowing fully my feelings or how i am doing today since we do not see each other as we work on opposite ends of the building. but having that soup and talking to her, i just broke down. with my brother on my mind constantly no matter how much i try to distract myself, and having someone reach out to me to offer a small but kind gesture, i started crying. i realize how depressed i am despite feeling like my life is slowly back together medically and mentally. but i still need people in my life no matter how much i want to be alone. having someone think of me may not seem like much on the outset, it meant the world to me on the inside. i do not even fully know why i came on here to share this today, but i needed to get my feelings out somewhere. i am tired of bottling my emotions up, and feeling empty and alone. i just wanted a place to lay it out there. maybe it will make me feel better. i am not sure. but regardless, thank you for reading.",depression

i really just want some real goddamn affection. i want someone to love me. every time i try to talk to my mom, she calls me ridiculous or something, and it keeps getting worse. i do not know how these work but trigger warning for eating disorders be warned or some shit. i know she thinks that because my little brother has anorexia that what i have dealt with for the past years is not bad, because it does not have physical manifestations, aside from the days when i wo not get out of bed or talk to people. she does not care. it does not just seem like that, it is like that. i know because i have had copious time to attempt to remove my bias and look at her as a person and not my mom. and college is going to be even worse. i am never going to make any friends, it would be impossible. truth be told this is more of a stream of consciousness. i am just sort of talking to you because otherwise i think i would talk to myself, and that is a slippery slope. or create a person to talk to. it is really nice to talk to an audience that at least seems to be interested. this will be out there, and someone can read it. someone can know what only i have known, the things that have fucking devoured me for the past few years. no one is going to read through this whole thing though. we are each too much absorbed into our own little worlds. not that those matter. we are all unimaginably insignificant and weak compared to the power of entropy and even nature for that matter. hell we ca not even reliably totally beat gravity, the weakest known force. it does not matter any ways. my loneliness does not matter either. i will take it to my grave when i go in years, and no one will care, and years after i am gone, it will be like i never existed. forgotten. the pathetic attempts to create something permanent produce something so temporary that it does not even last the lifespan of a fucking parrot. but oh well. i am going to go cry in the shower, get out, get into bed, sleep, and wake up to an apathetic world which does not give a shit about anybody or anything. i will do it all over again, getting up, wasting another day of my life looking at other people be happy and people like the kardashians who rob society of resources and give nothing back. i will continue to question and hate myself and it wo not matter. because in years, it will all be done. there will be no trace of me. oh well. i hope everyone else ends up being happy. i do not like to see suffering, no one really does i think. goodnight, everyone. thank you for humoring my sad little thing.. my pathetic, sad little thing.",depression

-38.254402,-5.415121,"after years of issues i have just been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. here are my tips for dealing with the negative symptoms i.e. depression and lethargy. i hope this is not patronising because each person is set of problems are, of course, complex and unique. some things in life are difficult to control but there are many things you can control. i think the most important thing to do is to give yourself ambitions then make a plan to achieve them. hopefully you will find yourself dreaming about the future rather than ruminating about your problems. here is what helped me stop drinking completely. you may think you are only having a little every now and then but when your mind is not in great shape anyway, a little can have a big negative effect that lasts for days. alcohol is of course, a depressant. giving up completely may sound daunting especially considering how synonymous it is with socialising in western cultures but there are now some good non alcoholic alternatives available in shops and pubs. alcohol free wine is still absolutely ghastly however. try going at least a month without drinking. i expect the same goes for recreational drugs or gambling. i do not know much about those though. exercise as often as you can and eat healthily. the endorphins make you feel better, you will get in shape and will get a sense of achievement form being able to run swim cycle etc faster and further. if you join a club you will make some good friends too. personally i think gyms are depressing as fuck unless perhaps you are there with a friend. group classes are good though. track your progress in a log to give yourself motivation. go out even if it is raining. once you have warmed up it is great. give yourself a project or ambition to work on. immerse yourself in whatever you find interesting and find people who are interested in the same things even if it is just here on reddit. you might feel right now that you have lost interest in just about everything but there is probably something from your past that you could pick up again. or it could be something totally new. some examples learn a new language, a musical instrument, making something, art, photography, reading, coding, maths, cad. i hesitate to include gaming because a lot of games seem designed just to give instant gratification which i do not think helps much. i think longer term goals and a sense of achievement and pride are key here. just pick something to work on and do it regularly. share what you do with other people. minimise your social media use. there have been quite a few studies now that show a correlation between social media use and depression. dial down the notification settings on your accounts and phone and relegate the apps to the last page. i am not telling you to get rid of facebook completely because it has its uses but do not just endlessly scroll. same goes for reddit. try to keep your phone in your pocket unless necessary. find a few close friends you can confide in about how you feel. therapists are good but expensive and time is limited with them. good friends are better imo. maybe some of them are having problems too. you could help them and feel good about it. get some quality sleep. go to bed on time and do not allow distractions like your phone. if you have insomnia try having some ambient noise on in the background like white noise or recordings of waterfalls or thunderstorms. there is a ton of stuff like that on spotify. you will want a premium account though to get rid of the ads. there is also sleep radio. also important is getting out of bed on time. have a little routine. get up, make your bed, have a shower, sing feeling good and do not give a shit who hears. recognise when you are ruminating and make yourself stop. this is hard. sitting around thinking about how terrible everything is only makes the feelings worse. do not feel guilty about it but do something to drag yourself out of that hole and break the cycle. get up and do something. do that thing you have been putting off doing. clean the kitchen. if you are doing it in bed try thinking about what you want to achieve tomorrow. avoid shift work. it is really not good for you. get a pet. or even just a plant. look after it well. listen to music but avoid the genres and songs that just enforce negative emotions. if you get distracted by the lyrics easily then try instrumental music like classical or jazz. spend more time around nature. help other people with their problems. it is rewarding. this last one is going to be very controversial make a small effort to be cheerful and friendly. hopefully you will find it rubs off on other people then they make you a bit happier too. say good morning to the people you meet like the bus driver or the person behind the till. i am not saying that you have to go around pretending that everything is fine but little things like asking how are you? can help lift someone else is mood and in turn could lift yours.",depression

-13.526056,27.8031,"on the subject of mental health. x post r depression, r anxiety, r socialanxiety okay, so. first of all, i am going to project a few of my former depressive thought patterns on to your current situation, because i know in order for us to have gotten to such a depressed state, we have to have been thinking along somewhat similar paths. for example over thinking anxiety that other people know something you do not not feeling like your personality is able to shine like others feeling like everyone has a mental illness, but they are too wrapped up in bs to care etc. the first realization i had that set in motion the most healthy thought in my mind is the fact that science has started to go a bit off the rails. despite it is excellent record in proving all of the claims from our yester culture to be bs, and incredible technological advances, it is trying too hard to solve all of life is problems, and it is causing even more. when i was still in school, i studied psychology, thinking that the study of the human brain has to be my best route. my first reaction was gut wrenching i thought, look at all these things that are going wrong with the human mind, and even moreso, in my mind. they are spot on. depressed, check. anxious, check. they must know what is going on... . but they do not. all psychology is doing is now labelling all the different ways an unhealthy culture can create an unhealthy brain. and even more sinister, it is gotten to the point where they are now convincing everyone they have an untreatable illness, because it is profitable. so, what do you do? here it goes. i am assuming you have always felt scared to go in a direction, because you think things out to the point of exhaustion, and at the end of that thought line, you realize it is bullshit, and it is not worth it. and, guess what? you have always been right about that. you are right, because as a human, you are not meant to go down one path. we are a complex creature, who needs to engage in all paths capable of the human mind in order to be fulfilled. you are a much more complex than our culture is willing to admit. you are capable of all things that a human being is capable of, not just one. choose all paths, because they will all lead to a better understanding, and even more questions that are waiting to be answered. unfortunately, our society has spun out of control trying to hold on too tightly to the ideal of capitalism, to the point that our culture is now of one that convinces you that being an earner is primary, and being a human is secondary. it does this, not out of hate you do not need to think there are people out to get you, or me , but out of necessity, because the capitalist system is only concerned with its own survival. at some point, we stopped trusting ourselves with hundreds of millions of years of perfectly tuned evolution to develop instincts that drive us in our true direction , and started trusting entities that do not have your best interest in mind. the fact that everyone has not woken up to that fact is maddening, i know. especially, when you consider for me at least i felt skeptical feeling about how people were living my entire life. i do not resent my parents, or my peers parents, for being led into this way of living, and not showing me the proper way to be a human, but at the same time, i am no longer willing to go back to the way things were. this does not mean be disrespectful to people who have not come to these conclusions, that only drives them deeper into a state of not wanting to face the reality of the situation. instead, i would urge you to be friendly, but do not wade in tail. support others with your kindness, but trust no one is words, if they do not align with your sensibilities. love your parents with all the world, but know they too are not invincible to the pushing and pulling of our current culture. trust yourself, above anything, because it is all you have, and all that you are. i understand what an intense realization this can be, but i assure you, that intensity is simply you mind reconnecting with truth, and starting a relationship with it that will allow your body being to flourish. please, write back with any follow up questions. i essentially look at my state of depression as the waiting period i needed to give myself, in order to gather enough information about the world until i was comfortable enough to admit that it is all bs, and all i have to do going forward is follow what i have always felt was right, and things will just fall into place. i am telling you, there is an amazing world out their waiting to be created and explored, and now that you know why you were always scared to live life to the fullest, and that it was not born into you, you can become the human being animal you were always meant to be. quote j.b.s. haldane the world is not only stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine. no one knows what they are doing here, just go out and live.",depression

these dreams and passion could be so subjective but in our society only apply to things that are socially acceptable they were invented so that you have something to spend all this time you have on your hands . x b well i quit after an year to find purpose away from corporate greed in a pro social ngo career, trying to help people in need. i quit after another year of no motivation and got myself a research assistant position in academia for minimum pay with to hrs of actual work every week. i spent all my time in shutting myself more from people and smoking weed and mindlessly watching dramas and movies. i have stopped fantasizing the past few years and maybe sub consciously have given up on achieving glory, as i see it to be just a mental construct like my daydreaming which gives us something to do. i see our lives and consciousness as a choice less arrangements of atoms and molecules which has been suddenly thrown into an environment for a limited time and is aware of this fact. i envision human life as the time one has after he is pushed from a dark room mothers womb in a tall building and our life span is the time it takes for us to hit the pavement die . everyone of us is falling through time and we are well aware of the end that is awaiting us, but society tells me not to pay attention to such useless uncontrollable things and toughen up and live like a man. x b well i wish, i just do not care about anything ! i had to move from my research assistant position a year and a half later, as this was a temporary position and i got myself into grad school again but this time with good funding and excellent prospects if i graduate. but year in and man i simply cannot put any effort into my work. i am just too lazy and unapologetic about it. i just want to live this way as long as i could and die when i could not. the past months all i have done is eat and watch mind numbing internet tv programs to get to another day. i move very little when i am home and this lifestyle seems to have given raise to some health issues, which is slowly propping its head. but i still do not care and every night as i go to bed i wish i am sick with something, which could be used as an excuse to give up on keeping this facade as an contributing healthy individual or even for death to come take me. as a kid i had first hoped for good years of prosperity would be enough on this earth which turned to and . but now i feel like i have met my quota of time i planned to spend on this place and am ready to leave. i have quit a lot of things in life, so when trouble raises to a certain level i can easily see myself quitting this apathetic or very pathetic life, depending on how others view my life. x b i know that i should not feel this way, cause i have had a lucky and smooth life to be honest. my parents are good people who sacrificed their lives for me and my brother, there was very few external hardships i had to face economically or socially so one could say i need to feel guilty about wasting my good blessings. but i am not, and even feel a little jealous that i could not find something that drives me like it does for my parents and countless other living things. but just like this universe which is indifferent to any suffering i just do not care about throwing it all away and stop doing maintaining my facade. i feel like giving up on living life as you call it!

26.92703,-13.327682,"long post one thing that helped me recover from depression .... is knowing that i can never ever be cured from it. i grew up in an abusive family. my dad used to hit me harder whenever i cry, so i learnt to be a kid that never drops a tear. whenever i feel pain, i told myself that it is not and it will be over soon. sometimes i looked at myself from a third person perspective, so that i could numb myself from sadness, loneliness and pain. i grew up being a try hard positive, strong and optimistic girl and i pride myself for that. girls who cry at the slightest thing irked me. little did i know that i was filled with envy.... at least they could cry without feeling pain. my strong facade worked when my closest grandmother passed away, i did not drop a single tear at her funeral, but i started having nightmares. often, i would wake up in tears, in sweat and racing heart. things got worse, and i gave up sleeping. i was afraid to close my eyes and i wished the night would never come. i had my first panic attack in church, when the loud singing of choir and the large crowd gave me breathing difficulties. i ran to the toilet and locked myself in a cubicle. i thought my tear ducts were not working anymore, but i cried for the first time for a full minutes. a friend who worked as a social worker suggested to see a psychiatrist and subsequently a psychologist, but it did not work. the meds were giving me bad side effects and i could barely stay awake. i missed my old self and my normal life when i could sleep and function well. i felt useless, vulnerable and miserable not the kind of person i want to be. i started despising myself and i told myself, only a weakling needs help . one day, i finally lost to the monster of my heart and almost took my life away shall save the details here , but a family member saved me. i thought those who said i understand what you are going through are just bull shitting me. everyone is living their life as usual, while i can only reminisce the days before having depression when things are normal . i missed the old me, who was filled with optimism and energy, and looking at smiling and laughing people around me frustrated me. i rejected everyone out of my life and played games everyday. at least winning a game made me feel that i was not that useless after all. my story is going to sound stupid from now on. when i got my first pet rabbit out of boredom, i started to see life differently. she was only weeks old when she first came to my house and i would spend most of my time staring at the rabbit and ask myself why is this rabbit trying so hard to live? , is this life worth living that she always begs me for food? . slowly, when my pet rabbit grew bigger and became closer to me, i felt life is worth living for again. if i die, who would feed my rabbit? was the question that kept me going on. feeding and playing with my rabbit became my sole living purpose lol. i started feeling less miserable. on days where i could think straight, i went deep into the roots of my depression. i realized there is nothing about the past that i could change, i ca not have a new set of parents, i ca not bring my grandmother back to life and i ca not deny i have depression. in fact, it is sadly true that i am weak, miserable and i do not know how to express my emotions. it took me a few years to accept that i am weak af and that is perfectly okay. instead of trying to get rid of depression and aim to live a normal life, i learnt to live with it. i learnt what triggers me and try to avoid them. i learnt what makes me happy and will not hesitate to do it. it was not easy to observe yourself but after a year or two, it seemed to have worked, i stopped taking medicine and subsequently stopped seeing a psychologist not that it helped much though i told some people that i had finished my last counselling session, and they congratulated me for being cured of depression. but, i told them that i am not cured, i only managed to send it away for now. to me, depression is like an old friend that can come knocking at the door when you least expect it. but at least i know what to do when it comes i could say hello . i am not writing this to boast nor tell you this is the only way to recovery, but i find that co existing with depression has helped me to better cope with it probably getting a pet helps too . hope it helps anyone who chanced upon this post. edit grammar mistakes, my english is bad",depression

-36.770782,-19.659027,"battling depression is a skill. here are some tips that worked for me. after battling depression over the last year, i have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. the first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way i perceived happiness. before my bout with depression, i assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. happiness was my baseline, i didn t have to do anything, and i just was content. of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. here s what i discovered being happy takes effort. being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. once i got my mind around this concept, i worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. it s a lot like weight lifting. it takes a lot of effort, it isn t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. however, it is completely worth it in the end. not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but i will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. here are the simple things i added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness i was stuck in talking about it. i got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. we literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. after a few weeks it really started to help. i was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring so that put up with me while i battled through the darker times. putting away the booze. i don t think i had a problem with booze, but it wasn t improving the quality of my life, so i stopped drinking. made a difference. exercising. seriously. it might sounds clich , but holy shit does this ever help out. lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. while you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. lift that fucking weight more times, that s all i have to do, just lift it. the physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain i was feeling inside and i was finally able to match my mind and body. being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. it also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, i was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment. gardening. i never planted shit before. on a whim i bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers about a investment. best money i ve ever spent. the process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. i read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. i live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but i have a window with sunlight and that s all you need. having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. grow something. take care of it, and it will take care of you. try it out. meditation. i still suck at it, but it works. every morning before work i take minutes for myself. i just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. in, out, in, out. simple. i added stretching into the mix. stretch, breathe. minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. do it again more times. try it, right now. vitamins and water. omega fish oil , vitamin b, multivitamin, vitamin d. take them. especially the omega and vitamin b. after only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins i noticed a difference in my mood. drink lots of water. more than you are currently drinking now. it s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. daily log and journal. the world isn t out to get you, people aren t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. this was hard for me to learn. pick daily goal. that s it. what do you want to accomplish today? what completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? need to make a phone call? need to pay a bill? need to wash your sheets? once task, one goal, per day. write it down, that s important. write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. you might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. the feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you d like to get done today. big or small. just try. small improvements. do something small that enhances your hygiene and or appearance. get a haircut, trim shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. use some mouthwash make your breath smell a little better. doesn t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. look better, feel better, be better. small, tiny incremental improvements. you will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. understand that it is a journey. it s hard. for you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. that s ok. you can work towards a better life. some of the shit that i mentioned above takes minutes. the activities aren t hard, most are enjoyable, what s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. just fucking try it, please. pick a couple and try it out. you re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. yeah you didn t choose to be depressed, i know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. you can help turn the tides. i went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. you owe it to yourself to try. i think you can do it. you re awesome. edit speaka engrish brought up a great point just to tag on to number , keep your room clean! make your bed, wash the dishes, do not let little problems pile up take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. a clean room is analogous to a clean mind. edit andnowiknowwhy made another great suggestion find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. making something can become very meditative and self asserting. whether it is drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermach , threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. just do not do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. it can be very stimulating and i like to create useful stuff for my household. just googling the words easy diy and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r crafts, r diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.",depression

in a drunken stupor two years ago for some forsaken reason i may not ever know. i solicited sex from an individual on craig s list. while as close to black out drunk you can be with still having mild memory recollection. two four locos in minutes followed by a unrelenting amount of wine will do that to just about anyone i tell myself. this compounded by the fact that my friend called me over to hang out. pounded one loco then said he was going to bed. left me hopped up on caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. my ultimate undoing. now i am within certainty i have both herpes simplex virus and . at the time of exposure my life was finally getting on track. i had lost pounds of fat and put on pounds of muscle. i was extremely attractive yet even in that time i literally told myself i can t have a girlfriend till i m perfect. looking back i don t know what perfect was or what it was meant to be. i was perfect then. the best shape of my life. the happiest i had ever been. previous to my healthy life style i dated a girl for months whom i fell madly in love with. i was blinded completely. incapable of following my own sound advice. she cheated on me three times, and thrice times did i forgive. till one day she literally just left me. she never called to say it was over. we kissed goodbye and hugged and i said i ll see you later. i love you. only that was an unknowing lie. i never saw her again. ever. she just disappeared. i didn t know what to do. i was thoroughly distraught. i believe this crushed my self esteem. more than crushed it, in fact i still could not get over what had happened. the single most important relationship in my entire life just ended abruptly with no form of closure what so ever. this thing so real, so quantifiable just gone. did i love too much?

12.608475,12.5966425,"i honestly do not know what is wrong... me being a y o junior in college, my mental health has gotten so much worse over the past couple of years. last semester was the hardest i have ever gone mental boom and with spring semester coming up i am dreading it. last semester i literally failed all of my classes not because i was dumb, but because i just did not go to class and do the work. it is weird because i know that if i do not do the work i am not going to pass, but every time i try to do something i have no motivation. it also does not help that in the same semester i got into a car accident that i caused and it totaled my car that i had for four months. not only that, but we did not end up putting full coverage on the car because i told my mom i would try to find a better deal with another insurance and of course i forget to remind my mom and the accident happens a month and a half later, so the car is a total loss. the thing is that i feel like i have been dealing with this since high school as during my senior year i would fake sick just because i did not feel like going to school. i was not being bullied i had a very good amount of friends. i just had no motivation to go. it got to the point where my parents were taking me to see doctors just for them to tell my parents what i already knew there was nothing wrong with me. i guess the most infuriating part about all of this is i do not know the root of the problem, but i have too much social anxiety to go talk to someone and fix it. i have talked to my girlfriend about it and she thinks i got it from when my parents were arguing and i had to hold my mom back from my dad in elementary school yea sounds bad i know but they have divorced and crack jokes with each other now i could care less about the divorce. but also i had a horrible relationship with my step mom and mom in my teenage years. with my mom, the police were called a couple of times. i am rambling but the point i am trying to make is it is so frustrating knowing something is wrong but not know how to fix it, and also not knowing how to get help. thanks in advance for any replies",depression

0.030847833,-20.513311,"i ve hit a wall i need help. once again i ve fallen into a deep dark hole as i have many times before. in high school i was abused and socially neglected, made some acquaintances at most, didn t hang out with people more often. the one thing that kept me going was i was told once i graduated, it will get better. that s been the biggest lie i ve ever heard in my life. i still struggle with depression and social anxiety, i am still unemployed because i can t muster up the strength to pursue a job because my first one ended so badly, and i still struggle with making friends and social interaction in general, i can t even ask professors for help because my anxiety is just that bad. i withdrew from college last year because my anxiety was just horrible, i couldn t live on campus and i didn t do well academically. i m starting to feel those same things again now that i ve decided to give school a second chance. ever since i ve started again my anxiety has peaked, my depression has resurfaced, and once again i struggle with any and all social interaction. in high school i was bullied very badly to the point where my parents wanted to get the cops involved, my abusers manipulated me to the point where i told them everything was fine. even though they knew full well it wasn t. i showed them the bruises all over my body, they knew i was desperate for friends, desperate for a girlfriend too, so i continued to go there against my better judgement, eventually my parents forced me to cut them off, it was a few months after this that i eventually realized how horrible the events i went through actually were and i snapped. i wasn t the same person and am still not the same person to this day. my social anxiety and lack of trust for people were manifested after these events. i was no longer the happy and carefree person when it came to socializing. i developed a sheer hatred for everyone around me. i hated going to school every day in high school. i mostly kept to myself. i made a few friends my junior year, we are still friends to this day but we never really hang out anymore. senior year comes around and the talk of the school is college. my parents didn t want me living on campus looking back on this i agree with their stance, at the time i didn t due to the fact they knew i had a bad history in terms of socializing. this led to horrible, horrible fights between my parents and myself, i was so desperate to go away because i thought that was the answer to finally making friends. so i applied to the closest school possible and that s it. i didn t get in while everyone else got into their schools. i was devastated, and this began one of the worst depression stints i ve had to date. my parents and i fighting, miserable that i didn t get into the college i wanted, i was having some problems with a girl too, i had a crush on her, she didn t like me back, and her rejection was just the nail in the coffin. i couldn t even stay in classes. i d storm out and spend hours and hours in guidance. there was even one day i was sent home and doctors came to my house because i was just so depressed, and angry, mad at the world, i eventually got the help i needed, but then prom happened and the festivities leading up to graduation and that was one of the worst weeks of my life, i was left all alone, my prom date abandoned me the night of for her friends and left me all by myself for the night. going to the beach for the weekend sucked too as i m not a fan of the party scene, drinking, smoking etc. so i left high school on a very sour note, i was relieved that it was finally over, but i was told eventually things would get better as i left. they didn t and i feel lied to. fast forward to community college, things are going pretty well, i still have no friends though, but i didn t let that bother me all too much, i had a stable job as a lifeguard and things were appearing to be better, then things started to get bad again in the summer of , in the spring, a drowning happened and a little girl almost lost her life, i was not there during this particular incident, i arrived for the aftermath, management was fired as a result and new management took over, it was here the beginning of the end for my job began to take place. i was their best guard so they claimed, i worked over the maximum amount of hours and was a very big help at my free time s expense. i worked days a week on top of college classes that fall. and i got none of the reward. new management promoted a ton of people, even hired people and promoted those people. i understand management didn t have to promote me but i was crushed. this feeling eventually turned to bitterness and then into another massive depression stint. i felt betrayed by them. it got so bad that i didn t even want to guard on some days. i just sat down and wallowed in my sorrows. there was one day i threw my guarding tube on the floor and said fuck this job. management knew i was in a terrible spot mentally so they let me go. i also filed to quit two days earlier. i haven t been employed since that depression stint. i barely count my two weeks at dicks sporting goods as a job. i eventually get my associates degree and now its time to move on to a year university to receive my bachelors degree, i do well there for the first weeks and then all hell breaks loose when i started failing exam after exam, i start falling behind on assignments because i had so many to do. i couldn t keep up, so i just crashed and couldn t do my school work anymore, i was too miserable to even look at it. i knew i wasn t going back to the school after the semester ended, i was too miserable to even consider going back. i hated living there, i hated what i studied, i couldn t fit in with the crowd. it just wasn t a good fit. as a result i spent fall of with no school and no job. until i was accepted into the same university i applied to back in high school. now we are at present day, still no job, and now once again i am struggling in school. once again i ve made no friends, and once again i m not interested in what i m studying. i studied journalism at the first school, hated that, and i changed to history now and i m hating that too. i still have no idea what i even want to do with my life. i m on major now and i m still lost. i m seriously contemplating just leaving this school as well come the end of the semester. once again i don t fit in, i ve even tried a club and i got nothing. i m starting to fall behind on assignments again because i simply don t understand what to do on them. i m taking the minimum amount of courses as well and i m still struggling academically, i m still struggling in terms of socializing. things just haven t gotten better and every time there appears to be a light at the end of the tunnel, it always fades away sooner rather then later. and once again i feel like i m falling into another bad depression stint. over the course of my life, i have been abused, i have been depressed multiple times, i still struggle with socializing and making friends, i m struggling academically still regardless of what i study, i am still unemployed, i have never dated, i have been suicidal multiple times, and anxiety continues to ruin my life. i m at the point where i m just ready to die. i don t want this pain anymore. i ve been through so much pain and so much suffering and there just appears to be no end in sight. i have no purpose in life and i m a waste of good human oxygen. i m just so ready to wave the white flag. i really need a friend, thank you to those of you who read this whole thing, but i need help. i have a therapist but i don t think he s helped much. i

-6.027008,-2.0867455,"exactly months from my years being sober. some hope for those just starting what a ride. things have gotten so much better though. the first shot was shortly after my best friend committed suicide on october st, . years old and gone way too soon. he was the one person i could trust in this world. i was always addicted to pills from as early as . emotional growth stunted. only friends i ever had was the ones who would just sit around, drink, pop pills, smoke but never had any hobbies that will help one grow. so after my friend died, i was already at about mg of vicodin a day. cue the heroin. i will make this quick, i do not like to romanticize my past because it was awful. got drunk one night and decided i will shoot up. so i drove completely wasted to a friends house and shot up. nodded out, decided to drive back home and was all over the road. could have killed someone. holy fuck was i selfish. car behind me, pull into a random drive way. nod out, wake up at am thinking i killed this poor family. this was the state of my mind. few years of shooting up dope and i was stealing, lying, kicked out of my parents house, treating girlfriends like shit, and was just a morally corrupt person. evil would be the right word. i did manage to graduate college with a biochemistry degree but i never ran out of dope because of a side business. started becoming sick more often and wanted to die. losing jobs left and right. i was purposely shooting up over a bun a shot with my buddy hoping secretly that i would die, i did not want this life and i was trapped. the final time, shot up and nodded out. he pushed me in the backseat and drove as fast as he could to his house so he can leave me and call the police. he did not wanna get arrested. cop gave me a sternum rub and brought me back this was before narcan . i went back out, woke up with my whole family crying over the hospital bed. what the fuck was wrong with me. why was i so selfish and not considerate of the people that raised me and gave me everything. on to rehab, it was my second one. the first one i planned on using as soon as i got out and i did. this one i wanted to but at the same time, i ca not do this to my mother anymore. i got out and started working out everyday. i got really into meditation and yoga. i just wanted to be someone different, a better version of myself. i lost lbs from running everyday and lifting. fit, happy with myself. a few months later, i landed my dream job working on robotics in a biotech company. it was the one thing i had wanted in my life and i got it. i still have drug dreams years later and honestly, i have no thoughts about going back to that life. it does take time but fitness was definitely the key to my recovery. i am an addict to the bone in relationships, in life, in being happy, in being sad, in health and fitness. i watch what i eat, i work out daily, i need to meditate more but all with time. so life is good. this may not be too motivating but listen, i am now. i would have gotten nowhere the past years if i did not stop. now i actually have k in my bank account. i was always negative and living paycheck to paycheck. that alone gives me hope. i was doing drugs since years old. watched over friends die and lost some family in the process. life is hard but let me tell you, it is a lot fucking harder when you are chasing a high just to mask your problems. most recently, i ruined a relationship with a girl i really cared about. she was probably the first girl in my life that was a decent human being. it is so hard to trust people still and i doubted her motives. i mean how can she be with a guy that is so evil. but that is not me anymore i say to myself. i try my hardest to be a better person but sometime the addict slips through. i want things a certain way and when they do not go that way, i get all bent out of shape. things do not become perfect over night but they stop getting worse. this is a poem i wrote in rehab and posted her about a year from being sober. if anybody needs any help at all or just wants to talk about their struggles, i am more than happy to give you some hope. just remember, it is one step at a time. getting off it is the hardest but the longer you go, the better your life will be. do not you want an so and to live a better life. your family does not want to bury you, that is a nightmare. be smart if you are gonna use but try to see the light. love as always",drug_addiction

9.490932,2.5506873,"just a heroin story alright so i lurk this sub all the time, occasionally commenting once in a while. well i got some very discouraging news yesterday so i am just going to tell me story involving opiates. like a lot of people the story about my heroin usage does not actually begin with heroin, but with pills. now i had done pills before off and on for a couple years after a car wreck and i first got prescribed a decent amount. i had mg vicodines, about of them, and i ate a few at a time to test the waters. after that i consider myself hooked. i blew through that script in about a week and once it was gone i was out hunting for more. i never had a steady supply or hookup, so i never got sick or anything when i ran out. i had a friend who i will refer to as jeremy. jeremy introduced me to all sort of different drugs and our favorite thing was psycahdelics. this was all fine and dandy for about a year until one day i let him borrow my motorcycle. he had just left work on my bike, and me in his car. we were really close so doing something like this did not seem like a bad idea. obviously i was completely wrong about that. as i am driving home i get a call from his wife about minutes after i saw him and she is screaming at me and freaking out. i told you not to let him borrow your bike, how fucking stupid can you be! . screaming shit like that over and over, c, you need to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened instead of yelling. after a minute or so of calming her down she tells me jeremy has wrecked my bike and is really hurt and they are on their way to the hospital. this was my best friend so i immediately do a u turn and head to the hospital. i get there about a minute after they did and their is blood all over their car, not a little blood but a huge amount, more than i have ever seen in my life. this feels me with what i can only describe as despair, the sinking feeling in my gut that i inadvertently killed my friend by letting him use my bike. i rush into the emergency room and they are wheeling him into the back. he is screaming in pain and as i get closer i can see why. right about his knee cap is a massive hole, you can see him bone clear as day, his pants are red from the blood. this scared me more than anything. my friend, covered in tattoos, massively muscular and intimidating, is sitting there screaming and crying from pain. later on we figured out it was the foot peg on the bike that dug into his leg and ripped more of his knee out. i came back the next day after his initial surgery and he has staples on his knee area, and it looked like something out of a horror movie. i sat over there almost everyday after work, being there for the screaming and crying during physical therapy, helping him get whatever he needs. he was in the hospital for about a month or so, and he had surgeries a couple times after the initial trip to the hospital. as you can imagine they loaded him down with painkillers, vast amounts of them. this is where is really start to go down hill. i am there every day buying as many pills as i can get my hands on. vicodines, percs, oxys and roxys and whatever you can think of. if they made it, he got a script for it at least once. this cycle drug on for months, getting paid, going to jeremy is, loaded on pills, out of pills, sick, pay check, pills, on and on. at this i had a lot going on in my personal life between my and my family, and the people i had chosen to surround myself with. i left town and lived at the beach for about a year, just grabbed everything i could, threw it in my car and left the same day. in short i had almost gotten my life together completely during this time period. once i felt i had accomplished what i needed to at the beach i head back to my hometown. guess who the first person that call me when i get back is? jeremy. now at this point jeremy has all his pills and has also begun experimenting with heroin. he looks fragile compared to how he used to. this man i considered my best friend had changed into a different person, a man driven by his need to ingest these narcotics all day every day. i get my old job back and he has somehow maintained his employment there as well, and that was all it took to get me to try heroin. the price point compared to pills i could not turn down. i sniffed heroin and pills like i sniffed the air around me. him and his wife begun shooting up at some point during this period, i cannot recall exactly when, but i would never put a need in my arm. i never did until tragedy struck me and my family. months of being back in town and starting this cycle all over again i am at home in my apartment and get a call from the police department. the cops want to come to my place and talk to me about my brother. as i am sitting there drinking with some girl the cops arrive and i stand in the hallway and speak with him. they found my brother in a hotel room about a mile down the road. he was dead in the recliner with the hotel door wide open. i was the only member of my family in town, so i had to call my parents and tell them to come back to town, tell them their son was dead, and my brother was gone. i sat in the hospital by myself for about an hour by myself until some of my family arrives. it was over hours before my parents arrived from out of town. once they got there i left and walked down the street to the bar, and took about shots of bacardi . i got back to the hotel and the next morning i wake up on the floor of my apartment. that was the most difficult night of my life. the phone call to my parents might have been the worse part of it all aside from the actual death of my brother. all i could manage to choke out was you need to come home, matthew is dead . after i said those words i do not know what i said, i just broke down even harder over the phone, hearing my mother lose it and my father try to reserve himself in front of her. the funeral was about a week later, and i was to upset to drive. well jeremy and his wife were friends with my brother as well and said they would pick me up on the way. when they arrive they bust out a baggie and a needle. i put up resistance for all of or minutes before i gave in. i just did not give a fuck anymore, about myself, or any of those around me. the rush i felt, the immediate lack of pain, the euphoria. i had to sit down. i thought to myself, this is the greatest thing i have ever come across. after the initial rush we hopped into the car and went to the funeral. once i saw the casket the feeling was gone and all i felt was emptiness. endless emptiness. in retrospect that was the shittiest thing i had ever done, shoot dope before his funeral. this feeling just drove my empty feeling further. after the funeral i bought a small amount and a clean needle off of them. the next months are a blur for the most part, an endless cycle of driving a town over, buying dope, coming home and shooting it. eventually i did not even wait to get home and just shot up in the car or at gas station bathrooms and the like. one day i was feeling particularly shitty. sick, missing my brother, depression. i had drank and beer and popped a klonopin or two ? a hour or two before i drove to jeremy is where i loaded up. i sat on the couch and let that feeling sink in. i am dreaming, floating through space, calm and peaceful. in reality i was as close to dead as you can be. i was in this head space and i just got ripped out of it. i am lying on the floor, puking like i had never puked before. i could make out paramedics around me, and my friends off to the side looking at me. i am wheeled to the ambulance, black in and out. i later learned they use two shots of naxolone, and one shot of adrenaline to bring me out of it. the only clear picture i have of that night was my father sitting in the chair next to me at the hospital. i am not going to lose another child to this fucking shit. his face, what he said and the way he said it, i will never forget it. i stayed in the hospital for a few days to make sure detox was completely done, and never put dope in my veins again. jeremy on the other hand just got worse and worse, but he lost his job so he moved to texas where he had some family. this only worsened his problem due to the availability of bth down there. the first time i talked to him after he moved that all he could talk about was how good the dope was down there. we eventually had a falling out and stopped speaking, then started talking again and then fell out again. the dope had strangled his life, and his mind was breaking under it. now on to the terrible news i spoke of at first. jeremy was headed my to my home state. he wanted help from me but there was nothing i could do. i had talked to a mutual friend a few days earlier. jeremy robbed him after he tried to hang himself in our friends backyard. he had to go out there and cut him down. when he arrived in nc they arrested him soon as he stepped off the greyhound and sent him back to texas to face other various charges. i spoke with his mother yesterday to see what he was sent back for exactly. the drug charges and theft did not surprise me, what did, and what shook me to my core was his other charges involving their oldest child. she is currently . he and his wife were taking pornagraphic pictures of her and making money off the pictures to support their dope habit. this eventually led them to molesting her themselves, if not worse, i could not bear to know any more than that. i took care of their children for years, even before the drugs ever became involved. in my eyes they are my own children, and i thought about them every day. now they are in jail, and the kids are lost to me some where in the system. if i could find them i would not hesitate to adopt them in a heartbeat. me and my fiance are looking into options to do this but i do not think it can become a reality. i miss those kids and i love them dearly but i have no idea where they are now. this is my story. shortened for everyone is sanity.",drug_addiction

kill myself, i have always tried to handle things and avoid medication. i have been seeing a psychologist since i was . recently i have hit the lowest i have ever been. i was lonely, depressed, i did not care about myself, and i was suicidal for a long time until i met someone. so i apologize for this long story but i think it is necessary for some background information because it is really confusing. i met this girl and i immediately felt a connection, we had such good chemistry. we started talking in the end of december and started dating in january. when we first started talking she told me that she is done dating around she is looking to be with someone for the rest of her life. the issue was we were never officially in a relationship. but she would tell me that she is my girl and that she loves me and is only talking to me. i love her i really do, but things started getting really stressful, she would say or do really conflicting things. one minute she is happy and loves me then a few days later she wants to take a break and says it is her not me. then i would try and talk about things with her and it would just end up with her avoiding eye contact with me and all she would say is i do not know. then she started being distant with me, i could tell she was not the same as she was before. she always seemed uninterested talking to me and seemed detached. i tried talking to her and she said she needed a break she needs space and time. i tried talking to her about it to understand why she wants that. i would say that if you love someone you try and work things out, not distance yourself from them and take a break. she told me that i remind her of her ex, how i can get really clingy at times. i told her i was clingy when we first started talking and she said she was fine with it. we resolved that fight with us meeting a few days later and we had a long talk. i asked her what she wanted, she said she does not know. she said she was feeling suicidal and substance abusing, she takes meds for her depression and anxiety, i was worried and told her that i am not going to just leave her alone in that state. i told her that if you tell someone you love them you do not just bail when they are at their lowest point, you help them and care for them. we went out for a walk and at the end, when she was going back home, i asked her if she was still my girl and if everything between us will be ok. she said yes and said she promised. i felt confident. a few days later we went to the movies together and had a good time. later that night when we got back to my house i tried talking to her about things and she freaked out and kept ignoring me. i got upset so i got up to go to the bathroom and she got up angry and was saying she is leaving. i tried talking to her telling her to calm down. she was crying and then went to sleep in my bed. the next day we had breakfast together and looked at an apartment, we had been talking about getting an apartment together for a while. we had a good day and then when she went home. so the next few days consisted of her barely talking to me and when she would it seemed like she could not stand me. from before she told me that when things did not work out with other guys she is talked to she would distance herself from them and stop talking. i asked her if that is what she was doing with me and she said she does not know. she said she does not want this anymore which meant us. i asked what she meant and she said she was not ready. she said that she needed to focus on herself and her career and that goings were not right right now. she said that it is not the end but she needs a break. i kept trying to understand the situation calling and texting her but she was ignoring me. she ignored me for days and it made me extremely anxious. after ignoring me for the whole day she posted a provocative picture on instagram, something that she normally does not do and it was pretty clear she was asking for attention. the caption and the mood of the pic really gave the impression she did not care about the situation at all. i was upset so i told her off. she would not talk to me about things giving excuses. i said to stop blowing me off and talk to me about this. we got in a big argument where she said i was forcing her to be with her and that she does not want me anymore, she does not want anything . again i kept trying to talk to her about it to understand why she feels that way and what will happen between us. it ended with her blocking me on all social media and blocking my number. now i feel empty and suicidal. i know it sound over dramatic because it is the my girlfriend dumped me thing but there is more to it than that. i have been thinking of ways to kill myself and last night i started strangling myself with my belt. i do not know what to do. i do not want to give up. but i do not want to come off crazy and be a stalker. i just want to talk about things.

it may be insensitive and i definitely apologize ahead of time, but i feel that talking to someone who has lived through an attempt or dealt with someone close attempting, will help me understand what the fuck is going on. i will try and summarize as best as i can, but any kind words or support or opinions or thoughts would be much appreciated. to preface, i am not suicidal however in lieu of recent events i realized that i may have some mental health issues of my own which i will need to deal with. i have been seeing a counselor infrequently for the past few years but i will be making more of an effort to have regular sessions. okay, so let is get to it. my mother attempted suicide on wednesday. although the topic of suicide and depression and mental health is a regular topic in my family mostly in an informal or sarcastic way we never expected this to actually happen. for as long as i can remember my mom, as well as a few other people in my family, have made side comments about hating life, or talking about life insurance with suicide clauses, or going through what we call seasonal depression. but the context of the comments really raised no red flags. i thought that people who actually follow through with it were the ones that never talk about it. it was seemingly normal in my family. we are not emotional or outwardly compassionate. i would describe us as having very pragmatic and clinical reactions to most things. if something happens, you deal with it. you do not breakdown. you do not talk about it. you just get through it and move on. i realize now we were all very wrong and should not have been making these comments, but it was really just the norm. my mom never had a serious tone and never made anything seem like a cry for help. she would go through periods where she would not leave the house or avoid talking to people, but she is been the exact same way for years. nothing obvious seemed to change. then this happened. she took a large amount of pills and tried to go to sleep. her body reacted appropriately and she got violently ill. my dad her spouse of years found her on the bedroom floor and called an ambulance. she is known to take naps quite often or go to sleep early because of headaches, so her being in bed at pm was not uncommon. my dad said later the night of, that if she was in her bed and not on the floor, he would not have thought anything was wrong. he would have let her sleep. there was nothing out of the ordinary. i have learned this is a normal initial reaction, but she is making it very clear she hates my dad for keeping her alive. she wanted him to leave her there. she joked about it for years she did not want to be resuscitated. we were to leave her until there were no vitals. that was her request, but it was always said as a side comment. but my dad did what he thought was best and i am glad he did. she allowed me to see her the next morning in the hospital because she needed her glasses and some things from home. as soon as i brought them in, she called security to escort me out. i broke down crying which because of our demeanor, i never do and she let me stay. i stayed for a few hours and let her talk. i said very little but i wanted to keep the conversation normal. i did not want to pity her or talk about what happened, i just wanted to keep her occupied. i thought that was the right thing to do. it seemed to help because she was making jokes and i convinced her to eat some toast. and she opened up to me more than she ever has before. so we talked how we would in any other circumstance. apparently it was not because the nurse told my mom it was in my best interest to leave because my comments were too negative. the nurse said our conversation indicated that i have similar issues and i will not help anything and i need to see a doctor myself. so my mom agreed and called security and i was escorted out. my emotions got to me in the moment and i just kept saying you do not know her. she is my mother. you met her hours ago. she does not trust doctors, she never has and that passed along to me and it was very hard to understand why she would choose them over her family. i realize now that her family has not helped anything up to this point, and these people are professionals. we need them. they know what they are doing. so i really regret that the time i got to spend with her, i did exactly the opposite of what i should have done. i was the only one that got to visit and i fucked it up. after that, she requested no visitors and made all of her information confidential. if we call or try to visit, they deny that she is even a patient. so we know nothing. no one has had any contact since i was kicked out. nothing. not a word. we have to wait until she is ready to see or talk to us. all we know is that she will be there for the hour hold and can leave at the doctor is discretion. they are not required to tell us anything, so we do not know if she has to be released to someone is care or if she will be able to call a cab and go home. we have no idea. i think most of the reason for posting this was to get it out, which also explains the wall of text. i wanted to tell people who do not know me. who do not know my family. because the future is unknown, the waiting is driving me nuts. my mind wo not stop racing and i am just trying to wrap my head around an outcome that is impossible to predict. we do not know what to expect or how to react when we can see her or when she comes home and it is very hard to deal with. we are all very scared. if anyone is willing to take the time to read this and try and understand my point of view and pass along anything helpful, i will be surprised, but also very grateful. stay strong everyone. i know that the world for me and my family just turned upside down and this event will definitely change my outlook on life and family and love and friendship and everything else that i have always taken for granted, that i have always joked about. i hate that it took something as serious and heartbreaking as this to make me realize it and i hope my mom has not given up.",suicidality

5.6250644,-8.235189,"my existence is worthless and pathetic i am an year old guy with a shitty life. no matter what i do, i end up finding people who despise and bully me. i always end up feeling lonely, and without any close friends. for once in my life, i just want at least one close friend who understands me. there is probably something wrong with me that is pushing everyone away. with the amount of people that hate me nowadays, i do not think i can last any longer. i should just die. when i was a young child, i almost seemed to have a great life. i was the well behaved kid who got straight a is and skipped a grade, was well loved by my parents, and got along with various adults. that was just the surface. i was constantly bullied in school, and my classmates barely talked to me. the bullying took a toll on me. i became less talkative, more anxious, and less trusting of people. i rarely told teachers that others bullied me because my harassers would find a way to lie and convince that they were innocent. my parents told me to do something to protect myself or fight back, but i never fought back and became a doormat. by the time i was in high school, my social skills had deteriorated so much that friendships seemed impossible to me. it was not like i wanted to befriend anyone at that point, and i was still bullied. people would taunt me and verbally abuse me. i was too damn traumatized to get close to anyone, and spent my free time on video games, anime, and art. i only kept up my grades with brute determination. my cats kept my life sane. at least i got unconditional love from them until they both died. at , i got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. i went through so many different meds that put my emotions on a roller coaster. one made me feel like a zombie. another just made my depression worse. none of my meds seemed to help, and i just stopped taking them. my high school life was a train wreck. i kept going to high school even though i never ended up getting close to anyone, even though i was bullied, and even though my parents had trouble understanding my depression and social anxiety. getting up to go to school took too much motivation. i skipped most of my school days to stay in bed, and locked myself up in my own room except for going out to use the bathroom or eat. my life was hell. i felt like rotting on the inside. by a stroke of luck, i only managed to graduate high school because i eventually told my guidance counselor about my depression. fast forward to my first semester of college. it was a huge improvement from high school. i found new friends. i was never close to them, but i still enjoyed their company. unfortunately, i was just a tag along. no matter what i do, i could never get close to them. i usually ended up being the butt of all the jokes in the group, and i was a doormat again. they came to me for help, for advice, and to vent about their problems. i did not mind helping them, but whenever i wanted to talk to them about anything, i felt like i was ignored, made fun of, or not taken seriously. one of the few people i actually felt comfortable talking to in that group was another guy who had similar tastes in video games and tv shows. i enjoyed having conversations with him on facebook about them. i did not talk much to him in person compared to online because i thought he would end up thinking that i was a weirdo, and my bad social skills in person probably makes me look stupid in person. then, my second semester came about. i still saw these friends as friends even though they started to get a bit toxic towards me. most of them were not emotionally mature. i remember suddenly feeling really hyper with a ton of energy out of nowhere during that time without taking any drugs. i started to impulsively spend my money on overpriced video games, a new bike, and other dumb things like food i could never finish eating before expiring. i decided to do ten courses in one semester, and somehow survived them all with straight a is. i found a new job, and then felt like quitting it a month later. everything was just crazy. i probably had a case of undiagnosed bipolar mania. i still need to see a psychiatrist about that. summer break started, and my college friends started dislike me more because of how i acted during my second semester. my friendships were shaky. i posted the same things i usually post on facebook my art, jokes and puns, random thoughts on text posts, and reposts of video games and anime related stuff i liked. the only difference was i was still hyper for most of the summer, and posted more stuff than usual. some of my reposts ended up unintentionally being the same post reposted by the friend whom i mentioned that i got along on facebook. it was a coincidence, and i had no idea he reposted them at the time. if there was a friendship hierarchy, my college friends definitely respected him more than me, and i got accused of trying too hard to copy him. i just happened to have similar interests. my college friends played mind games with me, lied to me, and mocked my interests and hobbies on facebook posts and the group chat we were in. i thought college students were more mature than high school students, but nope. i got myself stuck with immature people again. it got to the point where i mentioned to them to stop being shitty towards me. they ended up telling me they hated me, and got kicked out. i ca not even get back into the things i like because of the trauma from everything that happened. if i went through a phase of bipolar mania, then i went back down in depression again. i am back in my own personal hell again. i do not even know if i want to go back to college. with the amount of stress on me, my grades will drop again and it will be even worse than high school since my college is far from home. what makes things even more complicated is that i wanted to transfer to another school the semester after to focus on an animation major because my college does not have an animation major. if i took time off college, i ca not transfer because the transfer application needs a transcript of my grades during the semester right before the semester that i will be transferring to the other college. if i ca not even handle my next semester, how the hell am i going to handle my hellhole of a life? i have pissed off a huge amount of people no matter where i go whether it is my hometown or at college. there is no future for me anywhere. people will hate me anywhere i go. there must be something wrong with me. honestly, i am just so fucking stupid for this rant over some issue that just is not as bad as what other people are going through worrying over some minor issue of human relations and my bad social skills. i am so deep in wallowing in self pity that i am lower than the most disgusting piece of trash. i want to die by next week.",suicidality
