15.346866,36.445015,days in and i m feeling so nauseous but so motivated i ve been a daily smoker for six years but the past two years i have been dabbing at an expensive and unhealthy rate i m talking at least dabs a day g before work after work and even in the middle of the night some nights anything to chase that stoned feeling right well i would end up chasing it all day only to never truly find that first high of the day feeling again however i would keep trying and throwing money away because i thought weed was helping me deal with my anxiety and depression i was constantly worried about going to the dispensary oregon to have wax for work the next day because i had convinced myself that the anxiety i had before work in the morning would only go away if i got stoned so i went stoned every single day and attributed this connection to be beneficial and truly it was for the first few years until it just wasn t anymore and then i ended up stumbling across this subreddit a few weeks ago and haven t looked at myself and my marijuana use the same this thread made me question if weed was helping or hurting me i guess i ve known it has been hurting me especially the last few months but that s because i was letting my marijuana use impact my life and mental health and i just didn t realize this fully personal moderation is key when it comes to marijuana and unfortunately i fell down the rabbit hole of absolutely no moderation let me be clear when i say i have never intentionally quit smoking and those one two three day breaks i have had over the years stemmed mainly from really broke days or trips where i couldn t get have it honestly tolerance breaks were laughable to me because i couldn t imagine myself having any control over the amount i smoked since being high for as many hours a day as possible was my main only daily motive after a few weeks of lingering here in this subreddit i decided i wanted to quit cold turkey and i did i took my last hit from a dab pen at pm on june th so it s only been something short of days that i ve had to use self control in a way i never thought i would care to first day i was super hyped on my decision to quit and had the most confidence in myself but just felt off somehow second day i m feeling that same confidence but my body is letting me know how reliant i have been on weed and how much my body expects the thc to be in my system because i ve been sweaty irritable and nauseous the majority of today although it seems like it would be such a great idea to just take a hit to make it go away i will not because i want better for myself better in the sense that i don t want to need a substance to function everyday i want to function on my own with a clear head and cold turkey is my only way this thread has been so helpful these past few weeks and especially these past two days anytime i feign i jump on here and am reminded of what i want and how i will get there if i truly decide i want to i will continue to jump on here for support because none of us are alone in this journey the motivation here on r leaves has been immense so thank you good luck to you and i ll be lurking,addiction
3.8573227,25.242329,i feel like i ca not quit hi everyone firstly i want to thank all of you for being such a great community i love reading your stories of encouragement and it is really helping motivate me to change my life but here is my situation about two months ago i stopped smoking pot the first few days were great my sleeping patterns were a little off but it seemed to be getting better and better the longer i abstained i am in the middle of graduate school currently and i felt like my studies were benefitting from having a sober mind and then seemingly out of no where after weeks of not smoking i started having really intense panic attacks almost daily i am a music major and with that comes a lot of performances now i am not one to usually get stage fright especially when i am playing with a big group i have played in an orchestra for years but after quitting one day in rehearsal i started having a panic attack and it kind of started a chain reaction of anxiety to the point where i had to leave in the middle of a presentation that i was giving during the following week due to a panic attack that was probably one of the most humiliating things i have ever experienced at this point i have returned to smoking simply because i ca not afford to have this kind of anxiety at this point in my life granted smoking again has not really dissuaded the anxiety maybe a tiny bit but i am definitely convinced that these panic attacks started as a result of my sudden quitting of cannabis does anyone have a similar experience of these withdrawals and does it get better should i quit altogether or cut back significantly thanks for any advice,addiction
-36.19801,16.318562,day entering day of no jerking off weed or overeating yesterday was fine i did stuff with my girlfriend all day and it is a very different experience being active throughout the day i still feel the urge to just get high and sit around all day this sort of impulsive feeling to just let it all go i guess you would call that escapism but i see glimpses of the mindset that keeps one present keeps one in the moment and participating and caring about things like bits of sunlight through a cloudy haze of smoke i do not think i have got this thing beat i do not want to make that mistake i still do not have a long term foundation for happiness that does not involve getting high on something whether it be weed orgasm tv or food but i think i can handle today and tomorrow and that is enough for now we ended the night cooking and it was pretty good but near the end i had a second serving and more ice cream than i would have liked i was freaking out internally days ago i would have said fuck it and smoked away the guilt but i logged everything and found that i was actually still below my calorie goal i took that as a reminder that a single fuck up does not justify throwing everything i have worked for to the wind i am not gonna lie not hearing from my quitting buddies either makes me think they do not care anymore or they are not getting a notification when i mention them either way it is kind of a bummer so if you are on my list let me know if you would like to be taken off otherwise please tell me how you are doing u zenny u throwawaybutter u riddick u hoogityboogitiesrip u ask me if im drunk day deep breath here we go,addiction

31.334248,24.893826,just keep working at it you can change hey everyone first time posting here and i thought that it was the best place to post my struggles along with what has helped me personally i have a hard time with depression and anxiety i don t feel comfortable at all in my own skin and without my meds my anxiety overwhelms me to the point i can t get anything important done i remember feeling this way since i was about years old my mind was always quick to overthink and overall emotionally disable me i promptly became a functioning addict it began with weed and nicotine for about years i smoked weed everyday before and after school along with drinking and generally just being a pain in the ass for my parents but they didn t understand what i felt and honestly neither did i i began taking psychedelics when i was and that was my tipping point i became obsessed with trying to explore my mind with substances but long story cut short is that it ended with a pill addiction to opioid xanax i ll mention that during this time about years i was attending university and working hours a week while on these substances i don t know how but i was able to i often used this when reasoning with myself if my choices were for the best the substances always talked for me but about months ago i withdrew for the first time and realized what a problem i had i immediately started seeing a doctor it actually took tries for me to find the right doctor who actually listened to me and worked with me when i got put on the right stuff my desire to seek out substances almost disappeared i ve realized how controlled my mind was by drugs i thought they would fix me but they didn t a doctor s job is to do that everyday now i feel better and better i find that a good technique for overcoming my thoughts about seeking out substances has been deep breathing just focus on your breathing and only your breathing inhale through the nose hold momentarily exhale through the mouth count the breaths and breathe slow and steady it tends to almost be a reset button for my mind i m not completely through the struggle i have relapsed a few times but haven t fallen into an addiction hole again yet just realize that if you work on yourself and put in the effort changes will come positivity in life starts with you and once you accept a positive message your mind and body will follow good luck guys keep at it,addiction

-37.707336,18.807264,could use some advice hello sorry if this post is self centered but i am asking for advice for myself i am facing an issue with my gf and could use someone else is input here is the back story we have been dating almost two years we met in a bar when she had relapsed after her stint in rehab at the time i did not know she had a problem a few months into it after another relapse her parents made her tell me since then i have tried to be as supportive as i could i mostly stopped going out i drink on very rare occasions i travel for business a few times a year i do not hang out with any friends except my roommates as all my friends drink i have drank once or twice when she was around at my birthday party and there may have been another occasion during the two years we have been going out she is relapsed a number of times i lost track of how many but it is not that often when she relapses she has a tendency to drive and has damaged her car lightly a few times after i had found out at first i tried to not let it bother me and roll with it a few times later i told her that she is jeopardizing our relationship and that we would break up if she kept relapsing since then there have been a few last chances last time she relapsed i told her that i have had enough and refused to take care of her that prompted her to start going to meetings and she is been pretty goof for a few months she got a sponsor was attending meetings once or twice a week and things looked well yesterday she relapsed again so here is the thing i can handle it i can be supportive i can try to not let my frustration show unfortunately i am loosing patience i miss my social life i miss having a good time with friends i have missed many opportunities to go out with people who could potentially further my career i guess i could have gone out and not told her about it but that is not how i roll even though i can handle it i am not sure if i want to right now i am getting to the point where i do not want to be in this situation i like our relationship and do not want to break up with her but i really do not want to worry about her sobriety so i guess what i am looking for is someone who is been in a similar situation and how it worked out any advice would also be appreciated thanks reddit,addiction

has compromised your morals and integrity and you are buying weed with your parents money and maybe if you are honest with yourself there is nothing in the world you would rather do than have a week of complete freedom with a huge sack of weed and smoke and smoke and smoke and then smoke some more maybe a part of you knows that is true and maybe a part of you is crying out for help begging to be released from torment maybe you hear the cries and maybe you silence them you ve started making lists of drawbacks to smoking costs lots of money lowers motivation encourages poor eating increases social awkwardness you ve done a few trial runs without it even lasted nearly a month one time it s no heroin but the withdrawals are very real and the symptoms strike like clockwork insomnia complete lack of appetite irritability maybe some nausea maybe some panic attacks if you re one of the cursed ones but the worst part of it all is the overwhelming feeling that something is missing your mind feels like a bowl of cereal without milk not feeling up to par you have a brief daydream of smoking and it hits you smoking would make that feeling go away if you smoke your well being will be whole your cereal bowl lush and that s what always gets you it s not the irritability or the insomnia it s the passage of time enough time to clear your mind of cobwebs but not enough time to restore water serotonin dopamine to the harbor and you crawl back to mary or maybe you jog only this time reluctantly your life has become muddled you are bouncing back and forth between two diverging paths after going on again and off again the drawbacks of smoking are crystal clear it robs you of your natural spark and enthusiasm weakens your motivation and discipline scrambles your memory lowers your intelligence wit depletes your bank account makes you feel all crusty and pasty when you wake up in the morning gives you social anxiety and reduces your athletic prowess not to mention you re inhaling burning plant matter it may not be a cigarette but it s not kale shots and despite now being keenly aware of all the negative consequences you continue to get drawn back in sometimes you are clean for a few days sometimes a few weeks hell maybe you even went three months your grades improved in that time it even feels like your experiences with friends were more meaningful somehow but at some point you sail by that familiar island and the siren song beckons and once again you become lost in bliss or at least some kind of sedated pseudo bliss and all thoughts of the crew and the voyage fade into the horizon an odyssey no more damned if you smoke damned if you don t guilt and shame and regret eat at you constantly you smoke to escape which leads to more guilt and shame and regret you can t even think about how much money you have spent or about that brand new camera you got for christmas and sold at the pawn shop so you could get a of blue dream at the dispensary you owe more apologies than you can count missed deadlines unreturned phone calls maybe even broken promises about smoking your circle of friends is a circle of stoners the others have mysteriously drifted away your brain is full of cobwebs your body full of toxins a mile bike ride would do you some good maybe you need to move to a new town fresh start fresh place something needs fixing where did you go wrong why can t things be like they were when you were a kid full of wonder and joy now you are full of fog and melancholy you are lonely but don t want to be around people something needs to be fixed you need to be fixed there is only one friend who is always there for you you call on mary you smoke and smoke some more,addiction
-27.995523,12.784701,x post from r addiction love this woman completely but she went back to abusive ex and keeps using my non addiction past to push me away and tell me i do not want to deal with it you can see my thoroughly downvoted post history talking about trying to get information to help this woman get the confidence and self respect she needs to get out of this abusive relationship i do not want to get into all of that because this is not really the place but a part of what is keeping her in that relationship is that it is almost impossible for her to see me and my help as a legitimate way out she insists on basically thinking for me and telling me what i ca not handle or do not want to handle about her addictions because i have never actually lived with addiction before edit i should add that i have however had friends my entire life that seem to get sucked into it so while not first hand experience i have been forced to watch over and over again people get wrecked this just reinforces her feeling that she has to stay in this abusive relationship with this guy that has it setup so that she is totally dependent on him i have heard the conversations with him about how he hangs it over her head how he provides everything for her and how she does not like being trapped like that her self esteem is so low she feels like she owes him her life because he hangs it over her head more appropriate for this sub i guess would be that it seems like she sees his experience with addiction and his being there through her falls as even more reason why she owes it to him to stay so i am posting here and will probably also get downvoted to hell because i was curious if any of you have experience with the addict non addict dynamic and if there was any thing i might be able to say or do to help her understand that i am more than willing to deal with anything that she is got going on to at least clear that hangup on getting her out of that awful situation that so far as i can tell is making her more conflicted and depressed and make that substance itch flare tl dr as a non addict how do i help an addict understand that i am willing and able to handle her drama addiction needs to help her get out of an abusive relationship thanks,addiction

-38.11585,27.362207,i do not feel like i want to quit i just do not want to feel like this anymore lemme give you the clif notes mom and dad met in aa meetings though they both worked the ga na trifecta before all was said and done mom hooked up with a sadistic fuck of a human being and from ages i lived in what family services called torturous conditions got placed with dad who stayed sober but still did not know how to raise a kid lasted about three years there before he knocked my skull in and i ran away shuttled between homeless shelters and foster programs ended up getting placed back with my dad because no one really wanted to deal with me for long as you can imagine i would internalized a pretty strong dislike for authority and penchant for violence squeaked out of my teen years alive despite persistent suicidal feelings decided all would be better once i managed to transition to living as a woman oh i am transgendered did i mention that prolly should realized that the money needed for transition and the likelihood of finding a job as a woman with a five o clock shadow did not mesh so spent about five years meandering from job to job and home to homelessness in the process fell off a roof and royally fucked my back which was compounded by scoliosis the school docs had never caught and a cyst the size of a fist behind my abdominal wall that i had removed once and grew back my best friend who quite possibly had a life even more fucked up than my own started smoking trees all of a sudden it was like he had come back alive he did not cry all the time he actually wanted to do things he laughed again i tried it found the first relief i would had since my back pain started with my family history i always opted for deal with it rather than risk opioid dependency i started working out again got into the best shape of my life and came to the realization that living as a freak happy in my own body probably beat hating the coward i saw in the mirror and wanting to kill myself so i started transitioning anyway in the meantime my best friend headed downhill he would sought psychiatric help and they told him that trees were the reason he was depressed and he needed to stop smoking them and start taking their drugs he went through a few hospital stays and cycled through something like medications over the course of three years he decided to get a fresh start in a new state and i went with him my hormones were off the charts remember when puberty hit full swing yeah something like that and he was on and off so many meds that his side effects were nearly as bad as his symptoms we argued he kicked me out i let him and cut ties i built a new life from nothing again lost my car found a partner talked my way into a retail job and consistently outperformed anyone is expectations all while smoking got suicidally depressed earlier this year when i realized there probably was not going to be a time when my life became a normal woman is and i would probably always wonder if the people laughing when i went out were laughing at me spent some time in the hospital quit smoking started the doc is drugs ended up smoking after a month anyway and back to business as usual two weeks ago my best friend who had moved back home drove to my state bought a gun and blew his head off in a park went home to find out he would told everyone how ashamed he was of how things ended with us and how he wished we could reconnect i was one of his last friends that he pushed away and to avoid portraying myself as a saint i said my own share of fucking hurtful things when i was feeling hurt myself since it happened i alternate between autopilot sleeping too much smoking myself out of the reality of the situation and uncontrollable sobbing screaming my whole life has been chaos and the years i knew him was longer than i would had contact with anyone in my life including my own parents we spent most of that years seeing each other every day so now i have not smoked for a week because i am out and i do not have the money for more anyway i also do not have the money to see my doctor about my med levels or my shrink about how fucked up i feel i work hours a week in a retail hell that makes me want to scream and pay of everything i make into an insurance policy that with my shitty retail wage i still ca not afford to use my back is agony my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds and i am still a woman who questions every look people give me i do not want to overstate my case for the oppression olympics but the job market does not get any easier when you are an unprotected minority i still want to kill myself i am so incredibly scared of following the same path he did pushing people away and riding the pharmaceutical merry go round til i look for the fastest way out i also do not like feeling like i am carrying on the proud family tradition of addiction but the haze is the only time i feel beautiful the only time i feel worthwhile

-7.809738,9.40221,hit my day just wanted to thank you guys for being here it has taken me a while to figure out what i should put in this post in fact i have been considering what i should discuss throughout my last year of sobriety i do not feel like this should be a recap of my last year but instead a challenge for those of you considering taking this journey to take the plunge maybe just start by tossing out the drink you have right now and calling it a day night perhaps ask yourself what is it that is keeping you from accomplishing your dreams what is keeping you from taking this first step you know you must take having the knowledge that there is others out there going through or have gone through what i am going through has helped me to have the gall to set what at the time felt an impossible goal of one whole year without alcohol i appreciate all of you just being here sharing your experiences and providing some input the person i am today is in every regard a better person than i was one year ago i keep promises i set goals and accomplish them in social situations i am the confident person my drunk self sat there too insecure to get up and talk to i perceive stress as a challenge to be overcome not a barrier to accomplishing my dreams to be met with a night getting drunk and feeling sorry for myself with my wife and all other relationships i am more emotionally stable and available on top of it all i have lost lbs and have a daily workout schedule that is not to say i do not still have issues or that my life is perfect there is still issues i have to work through i still get depressed i still get angry when i do however i am more aware of that cycle of emotions what is causing it therefore having the ability most times to work through it rather than exacerbate the issue i am working through a bunch of problems i ran away from for about years being true to myself and learning to set boundaries and clearly define my expectations with others has always been a challenge i continue to work on to those of you considering letting go of alcohol for whatever reason i can tell you definitively that in days you will come out a completely new person for the better can you say the same if you continue on your current trajectory you wo not be a perfect person by any stretch however you will be closer than you have been for a long while,alcoholism

1.59904,40.75387,had to reset my badge feeling just overwhelemed and embarassed hope i can pull through this sorry about the long ramble hey guys so i had to reset my badge i had my last drink on sunday night this bender was only a month long but within a short period of time i was up to ml of vodka a least times a week then every day and finally a full fifth of vodka in the last days after getting a year of sobriety under my belt i had forgotten how easy it is to just spiral out of control especially if i do not treat my anxiety and depression i honestly ca not explain why i thought it was a good idea to drink again not like it really matters in the long run like i said i had managed to pull over a year of sobriety under my belt and through working my steps and getting a good support and recovery group i made the decision to move up to chicago to start school again since my alcoholism knocked me out of college in when i first got to the city i tried going to some meetings but things just were not feeling the same and instead of accepting and building a new recovery group i got wrapped up in school and finding a job and apartment and just let everything slip once things were going good friends decided to come visit and i do not really know i think a part of me wanted to feel like my old self again even though that old self was a hot mess so on sunday after a day bender ending at pm of isolating myself and letting my anxiety and depression because i started drinking again get out of control i decided i needed to stop on monday morning at am i found myself in an er asking for help because this is not my first stint at trying recovery and the withdrawls were already starting to kick in and i knew what was coming next i figured if i could get myself to the er they could at least point me in the right direction and get me back on track and i was unfortunately wrong i was completely honest with them about my previous stints with alcohol how much i was drinking currently and my time in treatment and the like but they took me to a hospital without any form of addiction recovery unit or help so i was given an iv with some anti nausea meds which i was not very nauesous to begin with and saleine and two pamphlets about cold turkey detox centers and a small perscription for mg librium and they patted me on my back helped me call a cab and sent me on my way as soon as i got home i put those pamphlets to work i think i have sucessfully called every treatment center and aa hotline and what not that i possibly could trying to find some help with the detoxification process all beds were full up in the places that did not turn me down because i do not have insurance so that monday was spent managing my anxiety keeping the sweats down and doing my best to chug gatorade and take care of replacing everything in my system not fun as soon as i was able to this morning am i did not sleep well last night i started calling doctors offices to see if i could get in to see some kind of doctor to at least asses how my body is holding up and to maybe give me some advice on how to help with my withdrawls the only place that was even willing to get me in to make an appointment could not see me until august th which really wo not work out for me i finally got them to say there might be a doctor that can see me maybe if i bust down their door when they open at tomorrow so you bet your booty i will be there with bells on trying to at least get a medical assesment to make sure my detox is going safely if not worst case scenario that er is a block up from that place so i will walk back in explain all i have tried to do and hopefully get a medical assesment there i wrapped up my day today by going back to a local aa meeting and making sure i start my attendence again another meetings in days does not sound like a bad idea i know what i need to do i have a game plan and i can take care of myself until i get where i need to go not to mention i have a phone list and a semi understanding roommate in the other room if i have an emergency but i need to get through this withdrawl safely i ca not believe that at kindling has affected me this much i guess i am just so embarassed about how positive everything was going and how easy it would have been to keep following the right path and yet my stubborn butt wanted to do my own thing again but it is time to get this detox together safely and i will get myself to another aa meeting tomorrow maybe even i just figured starting posting here and talking to some people is the right place to start just because i moved to a new city does not mean i am alowed to isolate myself all over again so thank you guys for being here i have been lurking here for a few days now and all your stories and support really help i have hit my rock bottom before this was not it and i am incredibly lucky i did not let it get there but i have got to be super honest again and that is scary sometimes,alcoholism

2.9423838,37.965397,i will probably get a lot of shit for this backstory i come from a long line of alcoholics across the board substance abuse and amental illness fall rampant all around me as long as i can remember so it runs in the family as they say i at a young and naive age fell too to the problem started binge drinking at after traumatic personal issues and it slowly creeped up to a full blown addiction years upon years later i spent my times at rehab but soon after returning the casual to binge to addiction status drinking begun again like a cycle felt like a trap a problem bigger than me now here is where my perspective changed all of that dark time i look back i realize i was literally entirely devoid of any real sense of self and spiritual connection any true realization of my divinity and responsibility to be strong a true realization of that level that makes alcohol abuse look like a joke to me where i am now i have learned that at least for me each sip any alcoholic takes is not automatic it is not out of their control it is not unconscious it is a choice i have learned believing it is a disease and something people are not strong enough to resist for any reason is the most crippling narrative out there for me it certainly was it set my mind into discouragement rather than motivation i was struggling still but thank god eventually convinced to try psychedelic substances which essentially showed me the power i had within me and all the beauty of the world i was missing out on and not touching in some drunken numb no matter how hard life was it was still worth the sober fight tenfold it just made sense alcoholism is a disease of the spirit not the body and i am not dismissing the need for medical assistance for the dangerous long term withdrawal process i am saying sobriety is not some hard thing you will have to struggle with forever if only you surround yourself with the harmonious truth of human strength and love any excuse for another failed day is only an excuse thoughts,alcoholism

12.563322,14.516417,what should i expect from my newcomer sponsee i m a few years sober and i just got my first sponsee he got sober a month ago and we ve been working together since then he s in the middle of a divorce and today he admitted to me that the main reason he came to aa is because his attorney said it will make him look better to the judge with regard to child custody i know it s very common and totally fine for a newcomer to start aa because they were pressured by an external person or situation i think part of him is also doing it for genuine reasons for the wellbeing of himself or his family although i m not totally sure what i m struggling with is if he s only doing it for superficial reasons merely to appear a certain way to someone else at what point should i start expecting him to do it for more genuine reasons i don t want to work with someone who is a year sober and still only doing it to impress a judge at some point i think he needs to start doing it because he thinks it s what he himself needs to do and i m just trying to figure out when i should start expecting that of him but it s a difficult thing for me to assess and offer advice to him about because i can t read his mind and know what his true motivations are but the fact that he was honest and told me about the custody situation at least tells me that he s being honest about that and not just completely trying to manipulate our relationship the second thing i m struggling with is he says he has only had problems with alcohol for the past year and he says he s not fully convinced that he needs to stop drinking forever it s totally fine that he s not sure about it yet i had the same feelings when i first came to aa but i understand alcoholism to be a disease that requires an indefinite commitment to recovery so at some point i think he should adopt the attitude that alcoholism is a lifelong disease or he should decide that he s not an alcoholic and yes i know one day at a time but i feel that there s a difference between taking it one day at a time and just failing to recognize that alcoholism is permanent is it wrong for me to not want to work with someone because i disagree with their decision to use aa as a tool to stop drinking temporarily with both of these matters again i know it s totally natural and fine for him to have these attitudes now most people probably do when they re a month sober but the question i m trying to ask myself is when should i expect his attitude to start shifting or am i just being too demanding or judgemental also i feel like a lot of this stuff will just work itself out because he ll either a adopt the recovery mindset or b he ll start drinking again and that s when he ll eventually find out if he s an alcoholic or not but i d like to help him get the right mindset now if possible so that he doesn t have to relapse and find out the hard way like i did i like him and care about him this is my first real sponsee so i m still very new to this just taking the time to write this has already allowed me to understand the situation a bit better and maybe answer some of my own questions but i d love to hear if anyone has anything to share,alcoholism

13.401322,35.17403,your thoughts on alcohol free beer and wine i just realised that it did not even come to my mind to try out the non alcoholic versions of beer and wine after i stopped drinking for me there is no reason to i did not drink beer because i liked the taste of it but because of the alcohol so that is a no brainer wine is a little bit different for me i do love to have wine with some dinners but wine needs alcohol to be wine in my opinion many times i wo not even take a refill i only finished or bottles if i bought them myself and was home alone in the evening most of the time beer sometimes wine to alternate wine really has that double nature to me but at this point i will keep on declining without hesitation one more day in the bag interested in your experiences and view on the alcohol free versions of beer and wine,alcoholism

6.7935405,41.020576,i just wanted to say thanks hey guys i have never posted here truth be told it is been awhile since i have been on reddit i am an alcoholic i used to be a binge drinker until the binges lasted longer and longer until it was every day then it was only after pm that i would drink after that it grew into some harmless day drinking it was nothing for me to crush a pack i could do it in less than hours without thinking i never was a fan of liquor well actually i had a long stint with pineapple rum that i would drink straight i never needed chasers with rum but it all came to a head during a birthday bash at my lpos house boss for non military types i was doing my usual thing until i was challenged to take crown royal apple to the dome still get sick thinking about it needless to say i ended the night acting like a total jackass even going so far as to text some women i used to know i have long been married i woke up the next morning without a hangover to the astonishment of everyone else but i still felt sick to my stomach because of the crown it was after that party that my wife confronted me about drinking not for the first time mind you it was after that that i had said miserably blargh i am never drinking again i had meant liquor lol when my wife pounced on the opportunity she confronted me on my habitual drinking and during that time i had agreed to stop partaking alcohol even laughed it off because i knew i did not have a problem day was easy i had been drinking until am that morning so i still had plenty of booze in my system that i did not even think about it i regularly took a recovery day when i would get blackout drunk so it had not phased me and i think i had said something foolish towards my wife about her overreacting and that it was already a piece of cake it was only until day that i was standing in the local safeway hyperventilating over a case of beer clenching my eyes shut resisting the inner monologue of myself going on about how foolish it was to give up drinking that everyone drinks stop being a punk all my friends flipped out after hearing i was not going to drink anymore and ridiculed me for it not bad lol just normal guy stuff but during that time that is all i could hear it was only after my wife had tugged on my arm that i came back into focus realizing that i was sweating pretty bad i have dipped smoked and everything else pretty much and have stopped cold turkey but i have never done anything as hard as not drinking alcohol i feel ridiculous saying it melodramatic even but that is just the way it is was after that i opened up to my wife that i could not do it i had gone through some of the most hardcore training the navy has to offer been on over deployments been through countless casualties and a ship collision but i still did not have what it takes to quit booze i did not leave with beer that day but i knew it was only a matter of time before i failed that is when my wife stepped in she said she had found some subreddit to help stop drinking and at first i scoffed i am quite the little dickhead if you had not noticed and that she had some advice basically using the advice from this very subreddit i am days sober and feeling fine i have not broken off contact from my friends but tonight they are all going on a pub crawl and i am happily sitting out i have found la croix tastes a lot like beer if you do not let it sit and linger in your mouth i use the lime and it sets off something in my brain that makes me feel good because i think my brain is stupid enough to believe it is beer i am sure i still have rough days ahead but i never would have made it through the first week if i had not had the advice from this subreddit thanks legitimately tl dr this subreddit has helped me stay clean for the longest i have ever gone thanks,alcoholism

0.3969941,30.557499,last night i learned a valuable lesson i had been traveling for hours through a variety of mishaps to get to this meeting i had been proud of myself that when stuck at one airport for hours i had not had a glass of wine i get to the work function and they basically shove a glass of wine in my hand up until this point i had been days sober i have really never believed i am an alcoholic just that i needed to get my drinking under control to get my life back on track i have the one glass and then i am really good and do not have another for most of the night i mentally start strutting about how i have such control and how easy this is going to be then when the night is winding down and i basically had made it with only the glass i order another one there was not pressure it was all me when the meeting was over my group of people sat to discuss and three bottles of wine were opened and it started flowing fast forward i remember everything but it was hard to get back up to my room and i poured myself into beds room spinning after having a lot more wine and more food this morning i feel like complete crap headache stomach lurching tongue feels like sandpaper i do not feel like the last few days wide awake ready to face the day there will be no running or meditation because i just feel awful physically emotionally i am starting to deal with the fact that one glass of wine is never just one glass of wine for me and i may just have an alcohol problem after all another work meeting tonight with lots of alcohol flowing day again gingerale is my friend ugh,alcoholism
0.15477544,37.764137,february here we go first post from a short term lurker pretty standard story here middle aged man married with kids like a lot of maybe even most people my age i have always drank but never been a problem drinker done very well at my job marriage still intact took care of things around the house etc no dwis no problems at work no majorly embarrassing disasters i am what alan carr would call a normal drinker that alcoholics would be jealous of but seriously over years of regular maintenance drinking so much time and money lost that i can never get back so many better things i could have done with all that time and money but on top of all of that the big thing for me as i have gotten older in my early s now is the slow drag down in my health motiviation energy and realizing how much more i could have done with my free time and money if i had not spent so many evenings with a drink or two and so many mornings days feeling sub par as a result do not get me wrong i get things done but what could i have done with all those accumulated hours and s spent having that second or third drink and over years the number of weekend mornings in bed because i stayed up too late to have just one more and all those weekend days where i did not do what i planned to because i was not running on a full head of steam and so many years grinding down my mind and body with low level and sometimes not so low level doses of poison as i said it is not like my life has been bad but alcohol has clearly diminished it and since turning i have been gradually trying to make improvements from my status quo i have known for years that my nearly daily ritual of having a glass or two of wine or a mixed drink after getting home from work and depending on how the day had gone maybe a couple more after dinner was degrading my life and like probably most people i have tried to quit or cut back but it is never stuck i guess that should prove the point that the idea that i am not a problem drinker is a big fat lie anyway lurking on this website i saw several references to allen carr is easy way to control alchohol book and i went ahead and bought it it came a few weeks ago and i have been gradually working my way through it honestly it is most refreshingly honest and direct look at alcohol i have ever seen absolutely brilliant pointing out in the glaring spotlight all the lies that we tell ourselves and society tells us about alcohol amazing i had almost finished reading it last night but was getting tired and did not want to read the final section without a completely clear head i woke up early this morning just so i could finish the last section by myself in private while the rest of my family slept not knowing exactly what he was going to recommend i followed his final instructions to a t and for the first time in my life i feel like i am truly ready to live the rest of my life without alcohol and by that i mean for the first time in my life that i am honestly looking forward to a life without alcohol instead of dreading the prospect of a life without alcohol i plan to check in with you guys from time to time to let you know how it is going and possibly for support if i find myself struggling but also to note this day feb as the day i pulled back the curtain and could see the big lie that is alcohol thanks for listening,alcoholism

17.121359,36.360878,read this drunk nonsense that i wrote and tell me what you think tl dr part of a story about a degenerate drunk listening to some guy at a bar talk about his dying mother and her failure to grasp the concept of voicemail hateful and obnoxious rambling jesus what the fuck did i do where the fuck am i what did i say what did she say did anything mean anything did anything happen will any of this be clear as i will or maybe will not come to find out probably not to everything you look like a fuckin whore what was that she asked i said this night s been a fuckin bore you worthless cunt then i got slapped not the hardest slap i ve come across but it wasn t the lightest it would probably be best described as a nice hearty slap across the face with hints of pinky ring finger and middle finger the most prominent note being her palm wacking me in the cheek maybe an inch away from my temple alerting a cut i had in my mouth to the fact that i d once again been an asshole to this bitch whatever fuck her anyways she never fucking paid for drinks and was a slut who cares my fucking cut inside my mouth cared plenty i d recently been at a concert where people were rowdy moshing and all that kind of mindless bullshit some cocksucker elbowed me in the face i tried setting the brainless fuckbag on fire but the security guards threw me the fuck out before it happened they didn t even know what i d been through the piles of shit and desperation that i fucking went through i d been sitting at this piece of shit bar for at least four of five hours trying to drink and all these stupid motherfuckers kept telling me about their worthless lives some fucking guy had a mother who didn t know what an answering machine was every time she called she fucking asked the thing where gary was and why this stupid slut kept picking up and asking her to leave a message what the fuck was a message this crazy old bitch would ask he d have to explain to her that it was a machine and to just hang up but the crazy slut didn t know what the fuck he was talking about she insisted that he was cheating on his boney uglier than fuck wife with some robotic woman who the fuck knows how this kind of shit happens so gary told me that he changed his answering machine to be a man s voice this didn t appease his mother she thought he was either gay or a criminal with some strange man picking up his fucking phone all the time i told him that he should probably kick her in the fuckin ribs and he gave me a weird look the poor scumbag i shot the same look back him and coughed some nasty shit all over the asshole s shoulder i hoped that he would get the fuck away from me maybe try fighting me so that i could have an opportunity to hit him in the face with my pint glass only after i finished my guinness though the fuck he kept talking about his stupid fucking mother jesus what an asshole i wished the guy would stop maybe have a sudden onset of leprosy or ebola but this fucking guy persevered and kept yapping like a drunk cokewhore fuck i wanted to hit him on and on about this woman i m afraid that i m starting to sound like the motherfucker he said that once and for all he couldn t take it and drove to his mother s house and tried to explain to this poor old bitch that he was neither cheating on his wife or gay i thought he was probably guilty of both the fucking asshole he told her that is was two thousand fucking nine and that there was some fucked up technology out there that when you called someone and they didn t pick up then that call was forwarded to something that is called an answering machine something that records a message for the person calling if they so choose so the stupid bitch asked to see this machine he was talking about i told him that he should ve gotten a knife and stabbed the dumb bitch to death right about then he tried so hard to explain that it was all digital like mom are you fucking retarded or something this voice is not a human just listen to the fuckin thing it s a robot you stupid bitch he probably didn t say that because he was a braindead pussy who needed a pair of balls sewed to his body he probably looked at her like a meek piece of shit with a bewildered and slightly bemused look gracing his face his tiny brain trying to process the immense amount of retardation that was transpiring in front of him so he told me that he kept trying to explain himself to this woman that was his mom but too fucking stupid to understand what an answering machine was i would ve fucking lost it even though that essentially denotes i have something to lose which i don t think that i do whateverthefuck that i might have or might have had it would have been gone and flying somewhere during a conversation with this lady i probably would ve dropped dead maybe i would ve gotten some scissors and cut her tongue out in all likelihood i would ve gotten on the internet ordered an old answering machine the kind everyone had in the s from fucking ebay waited until the piece of shit showed up at my house went over there and beat that woman the fuck to death with an answering machine there would be no fucking way she would still be unacquainted with answering machines at that point fuck that would certainly teach her a lesson she wouldn t soon forget who knows what kind of shit you remember when you re dead though so i asked the guy what the fuck happened to his dumbfuck mother and his shitty answering machine story he told me that she was in the hospital three blocks away dying or some bullshit like that i could tell he wanted someone to talk to so despite the desperate urge to kick him in the throat i asked him what was wrong with this presumably old bitch he said that she had overdosed on some fucking drug or another probably another streetwalking junkie whore sucking old crack dealers off for five dollars bags jesus why the fuck would a presumably year old woman be sucking dick for crack anybody s guess,alcoholism
-28.020779,25.865997,first post i have been lurking as they say here for a long time and reading of others triumphs and struggles this is my first time posting i have not had a drink in days and it feels good what i wanted to say is that through this site i have learned a great deal about alcoholism being of ones own perception and that there is not a specific mold to fit into before starting to read here one of my biggest questions was what defines an alcoholic where does an alcoholic cross the line and have i crossed it yet i do not know where i stand compared to others and i do not think it does any good to justify drinking by comparing my own to that of someone who has a completely different story whatever the case may be internally i am struggling the daily monologue of debating alcohol is exhausting i am justifying casual drinking to the best of my ability i am overweight because of it and i know that if i was challenged to stop for thirty days i probably would not succeed by my own definition and probably the definition of many others that is a problem that is what leads me here to check in to know that today is one day that i am not going to have any alcohol and i am going to feel good about it i wanted to thank everyone here for reading this and for being so honest and accepting to drinkers of all kinds,alcoholism

1.7815493,36.70867,would really appreciate your feedback on my plan hi gang long time lurker first time poster some background i have always enjoyed a drink or two every day ever since i was or then about years ago in addition to that i started sneaking a swig of rye out of the bottle when my wife was not looking since then the swigs have increased slowly and i am now at the point where i drink an average of oz of rye a day in the past six months or so there have been some saturdays where i have even consumed oz of rye in a day i have successfully stopped drinking for days a couple of times over that period and it was not easy but was not impossible either i am also in the early stages of a divorce the divorce is not specifically related to the drinking and has been a long time coming long before my drinking increased in fact perhaps i started drinking more because of my marital issues regardless it is very painful as it is early we are still living in the house but with no interaction and we have an almost three year old daughter i know i need to stop before this goes too far but i do not know how to deal with the divorce and quitting at the same time so i came up with this plan that i was thinking of starting immediately start by setting a hard rule of no more than oz of liquor a day every weeks reduce the maximum number of ounces by until it is if at any point i cannot stay within the max i will immediately begin going to aa i figure i can handle something like this while also going through the pain of divorce with a toddler and if it turns out i ca not stick to it then i go straight to aa also the plan would take weeks to complete which is about how long it will be before we hopefully have a separation agreement at which point the emotions wo not be quite as raw and i may be able to deal with everything better i know that stopdrinking strongly encourages aa but i would love to hear anyone is critical thoughts or perspective on if my plan could work thanks in advance,alcoholism

-43.04933,21.218355,how to reduce self shame social anxiety is real name by saying something unexpected isocial anxiety is an unnecessarily technical sounding term for what is in reality self shame something at some point in a person is life caused them to see people as a threat it permanently lowered their self esteem a person may feel guilty ashamed or embarrassed without knowing why but there is a distinct reason what we call anxiety is a defense mechanism at some point in life an individual with social anxiety experienced something that brought their esteem down they were made fun of in a crowd their so cheated on them they made a mistake and were publicly admonished ridiculed while they may have suppressed that experience or forgotten about it every time they are among others they retreat into a shell they do not want to make a mistake or be noticed as a precaution against repeating the negative experience the racing heartbeat insides turning heavy breaths the sheer panic that voice in your head screaming no do not talk to that person do not speak up do not open yourself up for an attack you need to embrace that sensation and overpower it you cannot wait for it to stop and disappear before you start approaching and interacting with people because chances are it will not go away possibly ever though it may diminish significantly over time when your heart is beating so fast that the veins in your neck are making your eyes pop and you feel you might suffocate from panic say something silly like but trees do not have any pockets or make a funny noise you will get a snicker and a few what lol and at that moment your brain should realize you are not in any real danger it may sound silly but here is the science behind it seeing a smile and hearing laughter is a physical signal that will be interpreted by your brain body as a sympathetic gesture and defuse the major fight or flight response your body is currently having more on this later to overcome self shame or anxiety you must realize the worst that can happen and then scale back to where you are and the worst that can happen in that specific situation worst case scenario type of consequences imagine you are in a crowded theater on national television with your gf bf and parents watching you say or do something and the theater erupts with laughter and sneers your significant other calls you worthless and starts making out with someone right then and there your face is all over national television at this point you need to put things in perspective you are famous maybe for the wrong reasons but people still know of you you are free to see other people millions of people out there quite a few with a good heart remember friday by that girl everyone made fun of rebecca black can you imagine the anxiety she must have felt when faced with such an overwhelmingly negative reaction being an internet meme joke what you probably did not hear is that she kept making songs and is now laughing all the way to the bank just kidding it is direct deposit but whatever your situation you are in ask yourself is this the worst that could happen the answer is almost always no the level of danger interpreted by your brain decreases then ask yourself even if it was are the consequences unbearable and am i in real physical danger again the answer is usually no if yes call police and the level of panic should subside a bit more now remember the fight or flight response we talked about earlier that is rooted in the sympathetic vs parasympathetic nervous systems the sympathetic system is fight or flight its nerves direct blood to the muscles and decreases blood supply to the gut it increases your heart rate and blood pressure this activates the body is immediate energy reserves to face the stressful state this is why people feel tired after a panic attack the parasympathetic system increases the blood supply to your digestive system and attempts to restore the body is energy reserves this is why i recommend saying something out of place by saying something out of place and silly you catch others off guard when a person is concentrated on something anything their brain is processing information relevant to that topic if it encounters information that has absolutely nothing to do with the subject it triggers involuntary physical reactions creasing of the brow a slight smile a turning of the head for a moment it the brain does not know what to do and neither does the body this strategy is more for you the person with anxiety than for those around you when people are self absorbed in a story or an activity they do not exhibit sympathetic responses they smile and nod less and if they do it is probably directed at someone else not you what you want to do is get people to exhibit friendly gestures specifically directed at you please do not confuse this strategy with wanting to direct all attention to you or anything like that this tactic simply tricks people into exhibiting friendly i am not a threat gestures they may have otherwise forgotten about so that your brain can receive the all clear signal and relax people with high self esteem and confidence do not have self shame they do not see people as a threat and as such are neither looking for nor exhibiting sympathetic physical gestures they already feel at ease in their environment that may work for them but for people with self shame social anxiety who do see people as a threat need those physical indicators to reduce their anxiety here is why i do not recommend telling jokes outright it is too much work for your already overloaded brain you are having a panic attack this is not the right time to worry about delivery and punchlines just blurting something silly out without thinking is far easier and more effective it is immediate so to recap ask yourself is this the worst case scenario answer no panic decreases ask yourself if it was is it critical am i in danger answer no panic decreases blurt out something silly observe sympathetic responses panic decreases again and should be at a manageable level you could also try initiating dialogue immediately after an anxiety episode remember that that is when your body is tired and probably does not have the energy for more panic hope this helps ads in response to some questions and comments i have received in the past someone mentioned that pride stops them from blurting something random out pride is usually the manifestation of hidden shame or the relief that shame has been avoided when people think a certain act will damage their pride dignity they are really saying that doing the act will bring with it the unpleasant feeling of shame or embarrassment in this case pride is the shield that protects the mind from being exposed to negative emotions on the other hand when one feels pride from accomplishing something they are feeling the relief of tension had they failed they would have felt shame they succeeded and avoided shame and instead are receiving praise the brain is thus feeling a relief of tension from the possibility of feeling shame pride often has negative connotations in religious texts because it is closely related or leads to arrogance and we can think of that as the belief that one cannot be shamed thus contradicting doctrine by placing the individual above god which society at the time did not approve someone mentioned that sneezing or saying something out of place increases their anxiety i would venture a guess that when people say something out of place the tension in the room increases and so does their anxiety because people do not exhibit sympathetic signals yet their attention is focused on you this article on the feeling on being watched is a good read it explains that we are hardwired to know when we are being watched i interpret this as a survival mechanism you are trying to identify friend and foe now in modern society we have certain social norms you ca not fight foes and it is pretty awkward to flee as one would have in pre historic times this makes your brain freak out even more because not only does it feel threatened but because of education and upbringing it does not see a viable response a way out you ca not scream fight run etc all you can do is sit and so the panic increases a sneeze turns others attention on him her and anxiety increases a sneeze is a sudden burst of sound and people instinctively glance to id the source as a possible threat when their brain catches up to the fact that it is just a sneeze they go back to what they are doing but and this is important that sudden sneeze that is out of place does not lead people to exhibit sympathetic signals quite the opposite they exhibit hostile or guarded signals because for a split second they do not know the source or intention of the violent noise disturbance the key to saying doing something out of place to reduce anxiety is the following it must not be a surprise saying trees do not have pockets in a conversation about politics is odd maybe humorous but not surprising it is a conversation so people already expect you to say something just not that it must force natural sympathetic signals from people maybe the conversation is too serious or the people in it too istuck up for a joke or random saying to diffuse tension you have to evaluate the situation and choose the right thing to say do to force natural friendly signals to emerge smiles laughter a nod a giggle a smirk a nod of the head a pat on the back a fist bump applause etc having a close friend you know well and who knows about your anxiety with you in these situations is very helpful on the comment about the connection between toxic shame and self shame imo they are very different things while i agree that self shame is toxic unhealthy toxic shame is the inherent belief that one is bad unworthy take the author of this post for instance i believe this author to be very wrong for several reasons he argues that this deeply held belief usually takes root in childhood and is the cause of anxiety i believe he is confusing cause and effect as the old saying goes correlation does not imply causation shame is not the cause of anxiety it is an effect the result of a traumatic past event people do not feel anxiety because they are ashamed they feel anxiety because in their past an event caused them to feel negative emotion what the author refers to as toxic shame is the manifestation of those symptoms the person is anxious and ashamed because of their traumatic past take this simple analogy for example john is wife cheated on him john feels embarrassed and ashamed john is afraid to be in another relationship author says john is afraid of commitment because he feels embarrassed and ashamed author says john is afraid of commitment because his wife cheated on him which author is correct author because he dug to the root cause of john is emotional problem the event that led to his shame and anxiety you must realize that people are in many ways the same as you they have at some point experienced the same emotions and asked themselves the same questions do my friends like me are my peers judging me etc they might seem more calm and at ease but they are no less human emotions are universal use this as a common ground and to remind you that people have their own worries and goals,anxiety

27.703972,6.7892275,is it any wonder i m still single so there s this girl we are or were good friends i ve had a crush on her for a while but she was in a relationship until recently a couple days ago i royally pissed her off by blabbing in public something she told me in confidence she s since forgiven me but she hasn t even opened any other messages i ve sent her i know they were delivered and i know she s been online because we re part of a group chat together that she s replied to i can t help but conclude that she s ignoring me and i m a wreck because of it i ve been checking my phone over and over just to see if that little check mark goes away i ve been losing sleep over it i keep second guessing obsessing over what she might be thinking feeling my stomach drop out at the thought of being pitied by her this post is not about her it is not about being ignored and it s not about the friend zone she owes me nothing and i m ashamed of how possessive my reactions have been what this is about is me being fucking fed up with feeling like a god damn middle schooler whenever even the idea of romance rears its head i m not a young man i ve been single pretty much my entire life and what few relationships i have been in have been short lived and wracked with doubt shame and panic my entire sense of self gets tied to my potential partner s approval i ve done lots of work on coping with my anxiety in general and am damn proud to say that i ve made hella progress in self esteem and compassion and patience with myself but all of that disappears when i talk to a girl which isn t entirely true i know that talking it through helps which is why this post is here in the first place sigh it makes so much sense looking back that i ve been single so long if this is what i go through every time for even the smallest things it s so much easier just to avoid romance all together,anxiety
7.64928,1.0342709,question about ativan i was prescribed ativan about years ago by my family doctor at the time i was dealing with a very stressful situation at work i wasn t ready to quit the job and so the ativan helped my deal with the very high anxiety i was experiencing each day ativan is not suitable for sustained anxiety and so i started taking zoloft once the zoloft kicked in i no longer needed the ativan i have been off meds for over a year however i will still take ativan occasionally to deal with a stressful situation specifically public speaking at work or an interview i usually take mg only when i take it i m in a great mood the rest of the day i am much happier more easy going much more confident socially at work and of course i worry less i am less nervous too i don t want to go back to ssris cause i don t think i absolutely need them and i did not like the side effects from zoloft i am generally an anxious uptight person and i see that a lot of other people are much looser and happier when i take an ativan i feel so much less anxious it s a relief now that i ve provided all this background here is my question is that how normal people feel all the time in other words is the feelings i m experiencing a high or am i just feeling more like how non anxious people feel i don t like taking meds in general would cbt be effective in making me feel as non anxious as i do when taking an ativan thanks,anxiety

26.85852,19.47486,i those few occasions that i do feel confident does anyone have this feeling most of the time i am very anxious in social situations and can hardly speak a word depression also makes it very hard for me to find the motivation to practice and fight the fear in real life scenarios sometimes i will feel very confident though and my personality completely changes like yesterday i was at a concert once the music started everybody started singing along and rocking out as well as me and my friends and we were having a great time i was moshing around stage diving and singing along with complete strangers and on the outside i probably looked very confident and outgoing but inside i felt extremely awkward around these strangers and even when they shouted a couple of words to me over the music i felt so awkward and scared to answer it was such an awkward feeling that i even felt i was radiating awkwardness on to everyone around me and as soon as someone was near me they just felt uncomfortable all these people were dancing and rocking out with other strangers and seemed to harmonise more with each other than i was it was a small venue and it was kind of a family like atmosphere amongst the people who were dancing and moshing and although i was doing this as well and felt kinda confident it seemed like i was the odd one out i am not sure if i was just not smiling enough or not making eye contact with others enough or something i am not sure very hard to explain not sure if anyone can relate to this at all the funny thing is although i feel like this i still really enjoy meeting and partying having a good time with strangers i just wish my sa would not prevent me from doing this most of the time,anxiety

16.052519,37.794224,doing an intro to a short story for a creative writing course decided to base it on my biggest panic attack to date just thought you guys might be interested would love to hear some feedback too i remember the fear i remember the sheer panic the trembling that overtook me the uncontrollable racing of my heart the cold sweats breaking out all over my body i remember the overwhelming sense of dread the feeling that my world was over i remember it all all of those horrible sensations all stemming from an insurmountable force the future for years the anxiety had plagued me all but crippling me preventing me from living my life to any real degree of happiness all culminating in this this breakdown although i was able to hold it at bay for a time it was now upon entering university and transitioning away from the world that i had known for the past six years that the anxiety came back with a vengeance seeing the happy and seemingly carefree lives others were leading adapting to all outward appearances to their new environments seamlessly meanwhile i merely existed day to day go to classes take notes return home go to classes take notes return home go to classes this monotonous existence would have been bearable however if not for the bitter loneliness that plagued me day in and day out the anxiety you see flared up terribly when trying to socialize preventing any possibility of making friends with anybody in my new world even the friends of my old world were unreachable another symptom of this unrelenting disorder i was isolated i endured this isolation from day to day assuring myself that i could handle it until eventually i could take no more one mere assignment one presentation and i was finished i broke down completely unable to even leave the house the fear of this assignment the sheer overwhelming anxiety overtook me entirely so that i could not bring myself to stir myself from my bed if i left my bed my world would be over if i did not leave it my world would be over it was all over i was unable to do anything for fear of bringing about my doom and thus began my rapid descent into despair knowing that regardless of what i did i could never accomplish anything never truly be happy so then what was the point of it all would it not be better if i were to simply not exist would that not make things so much easier this i realized was depression,anxiety

8.625811,37.12511,i have been doing a lot of thinking hi so i have been diagnosed with anxiety and took medicine for a while and after several years with eating better and exercising my symptoms improved to the point that i was able to get off the medicine and able to lead a mostly anxiety free life recently however i just got out of an emotionally manipulative relationship which caused me to look back and see a pattern of being in relationships with emotionally distant people or manipulative people in an effort to understand this i started trying to think what the initial cause of my anxiety could be i had a supportive family who loved me i was taken care of went to good schools and while i was bullied some it was never horrible part of me always felt guilty or ashamed that i could have anxiety and depression but that is another story when my life seemed so wonderful i have been spending the summer with my family before i start a graduate program on the other side of my country and my parents were talking about the past and brought up an accident that happened to me as a toddler years old apparently my personality totally changed after the accident and i went from fearless silly and always laughing to being much quieter and scared of the world the problem is looking back on it i do not remember it the only memory i have of the event is a dream i had about it it was very vivid and freaks me out now decades later but not what actually happened in talking to my parents is it possible for my anxiety to stem from this event that i ca not even remember i am seeing a therapist when i move but i figured i would ask people here and see what they thought i know there is no quick fix for anxiety but if i am honest my parents talking about what i was like before that accident i would love to see who that person would have become or if i still have any of that fearlessness or laughter in me anyway thank you for reading,anxiety

-38.16831,27.88587,parents or loved ones of a child experiencing anxiety how have you coped long sorry this will be a little long it s part vent release and part seeking help my yo daughter appears to be suffering from possible anxiety attacks and or depression and i am having a difficult time handling it sounds selfish when she is the one living through it background mother and i divorced years ago share week on week off custody my daughter has always been somewhat introverted and reserved very few one maybe two close friends not caught up in the typical teenage girl dramas etc being introverted myself i know that is not a bad thing it s just how we handle life but over the last few years she is really started to shut down she is a very smart girl advanced classes straight a b grades w out trying etc but over the last few years i have seen issues that i have somewhat ignored or downplayed that have pre empted the current situation problems with some teachers skipping some assignments but not enough to affect her grades at all missing school a day here or there where she said she was suffering from some ailment headache stomach etc that i suspected was not necessarily true but i did not force her to go to school this year it s escalated and a few months ago she did not want to go to school one day i finally got her to open up and talk a little she hardly opens up and talk with her mother and me even less and she said she just felt like she was overwhelmed with school and everything i convinced her to talk to both her school counsellor and to go see a regular counselor but after about sessions she wanted to stop i let her as she was not opening up to the counselor at all and was going nowhere the most we got out of it is that she still has some issues with the divorce felt that it came out of nowhere and we just sprung it on her which in truth we probably did it was not a blatant hey we are done your life is about to get turned upside down but i do not know that we softened the blow enough i do not know that there is a right way to tell your children when that happens you can only hope you did it the best way did we probably not throughout this i kind of still treated it as a teenager girl whatever stage especially as things got back to normal about a month ago she started getting isick again and missing school but always on her mother is weeks because she knows she can get away with more there than with me i have always been more the disciplinarian of the two of us missed two days week one on day week two days again week that is when we really started taking serious stock of the situation got her to talk a little more at night after school weekends she is fine and says she will go to school in the morning morning comes around and she says she ca not breathe feels like an elephant is sitting on her chest etc she did say adamantly that she didn t have thoughts of hurting herself or worse which i pray is the truth she was supposed to be with me this week but i know she is more comfortable at her mom is house than mine there it is just here and her mother with me there is my fianc and other distractions stresses so i suggested she stay with her mom this week if she wanted with the promise of going back to school which she assured me that she would she made it monday did not want to go on tuesday but her mother talked her into going in at noon and stayed home wednesday again looking back i think there is some more indicators getting out of the shower and minutes later she is still not dressed i think she was just dreading having to go to school and putting off until she could not any more not doing assignments that involved talking about herself her family staying in her room and becoming more and more withdrawn hard to see on a day to day basis it is been difficult for me to see admit that there is been a problem and frankly i have been and honestly still am to some degree a little skeptical part of it is i do not want to admit my daughter has a problem part of it is because i have never suffered from depression or anxiety no more than a typical istp j so it is been difficult for me to fully understand and accept what it is to be clinically depressed even though i have had people in my life that have been i do not think anyone who has not experienced can fully grasp it yes i get in a funk from time to time but usually there s reasons for it it s not long lasting but i am really trying here and i have to believe that there is something drastically serious now vs her just wanting to take a day or two off of school pretty cynical huh another flaw i sometimes have back to my daughter we have gotten her to agree to see another different therapist first meeting today hopefully she can open up to this one more she also has an appt next week with a family pediatrician doctor who hopefully can work with her on the medical side if needed but i know for either of these to help she needs to be willing to work with them and i just do not know if she will so for me i feel utterly helpless right now i have a fixer type personality if something is broke i just want it fixed a fight with my so let s not discuss what necessarily caused it let is settle on a solution and move on i have a slew of defense mechanisms from my own dysfunctional childhood and i see them for what they are but still use them and now i am very frustrated as i know there is not a quick fix for this it kills me to remember the bright happy year old she was to what she is experiencing now i have started to do my research ca not fix something if you do not know what is broke right i know enough to not tell her that it will get better that it s a stage and all of that i want her to feel supported and loved but i do not know how much to say how much to push to get her to talk about how she is feeling what is going on especially when i think she tries to hide it more around me i feel out of my depth here

7.3681974,29.319721,strange mental episodes can anyone relate is this anxiety hi all i have a history of dpdr which began around years ago however i have managed to bring it under control since then i still have weird dissociative moments but i am mostly familiar with the sensations and am not frightened by them anymore so usually if they do come up they disappear quite quickly after recently however i have been experiencing a really strange sensation over the last weeks which has somewhat progressed and changed over this time it began with a weird feeling while i was driving one day my mind suddenly started hyper focusing on itself and i felt my thoughts cascade into a weird thought loop until it felt like total mind loss tipping over the edge of reality it almost feels like my thoughts become so meta and my perspective almost shifts or warps for a good seconds sometimes it happens all of a sudden and sometimes it s a strange slow descent into this feeling and it s like i have broken through my regular normal consciousness and into an altered state of perception in which my thoughts don t make sense to me sometimes i think it might be my brain short circuiting or malfunctioning for a moment my mind goes into this strange meta cognition where my own thought processes become unfamiliar and warped i feel like i have no control over this happening it just pops up out of the blue and then disappears leaving me confused and rattled the feeling that accompanies this weird thought process was complete terror it is very difficult for me to articulate what exactly happens in my mind but that is as best as i can describe usually i would spend a few minutes afterward trying to decode or understand what just happened in my brain but that would usually bring even more feelings of fear or terror as i could not understand or even remember what just happened like i could remember it happening but i can t remember what it felt like or what it was since then i have had these weird episodes happen daily not all day every day but maybe times a day they only happen for a few minutes and then eventually fade away however as it is fading i can t shake the feeling of fear that i am potentially losing my mind or developing schizophrenia outside of these episodes i am happy social and function completely normally once the fear fades away i try and just get on with my life and usually can distract myself and get on with things as normal until the next episode strikes which leaves me shaking and scared again i am so worried these little episodes are the beginning of some insidious mental illness like schizphrenia i have tried so hard to explain it to my family but no one understand me when i try and describe it i feel alone and very lost and scared about what might happen to me i have stopped drinking alcohol over the last weeks and i am not taking any drugs pharmaceutical or recreational i have a history of ocd and anxiety if anyone can relate please reach out,anxiety
9.789114,38.966553,breathing for anxiety and sleep how to do it science of it and more breathing for anxiety and sleep how to do it science of it and more how can a simple breathing technique help with insomnia and stress the breathing method has been really effective for many people myself included at helping relax the body and mind ready for sleep the first time i tried it i was genuinely surprised the next day at how quickly i d fallen asleep it s also been successful for some sufferers of ptsd and anxiety at reducing their symptoms by stimulating the vagus nerve in this article i ll explain what it does to relax the body and why it is so effective how to perform breathing exercise sit up straight in a relaxed position keep your tongue loosely against your upper front teeth for the entire exercise inhale slowly using the diaphragm rather than the chest for seconds doesn t need to be a full breath hold your breath at this position for seconds release your breath for a count of seconds the tongue position will help you extend the duration of the exhale and you should hear the sound of the air escaping repeat several times until you fall asleep or feel calmer better to understand why this breathing pattern is so effective we need to look at the autonomic nervous system which is responsible for regulating the automatic functions of our body such as heartrate immune function and digestion two halves of the autonomic nervous system sympathetic nervous system sns activated when we perceive danger or need alertness increased heartrate and blood pressure puts us in fight or flight mode ready for action causes us to breathe shallow from the chest keeps us awake parasympathetic nervous system pns activated when our body feels that it s safe to relax decreases heartrate and blood pressure puts us in rest and digest mode causes our muscles to relax allows us to sleep the sympathetic nervous system is super important but with the busy modern life that many of us lead full of stimulus and stress it is activated too much of the time our pns rarely has a chance to take over which causes problems for recovery and especially for sleep using breathing to regulate your nervous system effects of deep breathing we have minimal direct control over what our autonomic nervous system does but via specific breathwork exercises it is actually possible to switch its state between the sns and pns when we breathe deeply i e from the diaphragm rather than from the chest we activate stretch receptors around the diaphragm linked to the parasympathetic nervous system any deep breathing will have this effect but it s especially powerful in the method as we pause for seconds in the slightly stretched position for a stronger rest and digest effect for many people the level of cortisol the stress hormone is chronically high and this can hinder sleep deep breathing such as in the method has been scientifically shown to reduce levels of cortisol effects of slow breathing furthermore the rhythm of breathing affects our autonomic nervous system with slow controlled breathing activating the pns this should come as no surprise given popular advice to take a deep breath when feeling overwhelmed but it was only in that scientists first found the part of the brainstem that seems to cause this in the pattern each breath is very slow around seconds so again it stimulates the part of the nervous system that allows us to sleep reducing effort for the muscles the last thing you need when trying to sleep is physical effort it generates unnecessary heat increases heart rate and generally prepares your body for sport rather than rest even something as simple as a breathing exercise can require some physical effort in particular to extend the exhale for as long as seconds it is necessary to restrict the airflow out of the lungs this would ordinarily be done by tensing up various muscles around the lungs and windpipe the method avoids this by simply placing the tongue against the upper gums to restrict the airflow considerably the muscles have minimal work to do and we can physically relax a lot faster summary if you re like many people who have difficulty physically relaxing this breathing technique may help you like it helped many before you it quickly starts to activate the pns and reduces cortisol all while performing a meditative activity with minimal physical demands you can perform the breathing technique on huma breath simply go to the app s exercise library tap on the breathing exercise and you re ready to go the app tracks your progress and guides you through the exercise so you get out the most of each breath x b x b i am sharing it here since this technique helped me a lot and this is a good explanation to see what is going on originally posted in huma blog about breathing for anxiety,anxiety

-16.148924,17.586176,anxiety over parents how to deal my wife has anxiety her parents are a big source of that anxiety they do not see danger and they make her feel like she is paranoid from my perspective they are doing dangerous things those things cause my wife to worry about them they are adults and we ca not tell them what to do and trying to persuade them what they are doing is dangerous is hard work we now have a track record of being correct unfortunately that has not made them listen to us more if we step back and say well we are not going to bother trying which is probably the correct thing to do we still have to hear about these things and that stresses my wife it feels wrong trying to control them but in the other hand they have thanked us in the past for being pushy over things that would have gotten them into deep water for example going out in the car dispite hundreds of accidents because of black ice trying to persuade them not to go is stressful because they just think she is paranoid if she did not know about it that would be fine she would not know to worry about it the problem is that they rung up to tell us they were going out to get blood pressure medication which also led us to find out that her mother has not taken any for a week apparently it is worth going out in dangerous conditions to get but a few days ago when the weather was fine apparently it was not important this has caused my wife to not only worry about the drive but also the fact she is letting the blood pressure medication run out putting her at risk of stroke and worry about the fact she had an tone when she told her that letting it run out is a bad idea if she did not know about these things then she would not worry but she does not want to not see them and they are getting older but the stress is not good for my wife is health i am not sure there is a easy answer but was wondering if anyone had any tips it is common to worry about what people close to you do like having a child who smokes but for someone with anxiety all the risky things they do not one or two things but constant is continually stressful,anxiety

15.111739,19.496332,realized so today i realized something important about anxiety i ve had anxiety for years i would always stop myself from doing many things in fear of let s call it it it and over the years i let it control me and over all kinda ruin me it controlled majority of my teen years by always not wanting to take place in many things in fear of it i managed to over power it for a few years ago and i was fine still in back on my mind of course but i never let it get to me as bad or have any panic attack s always kept busy always focused on being okay and that it was all in my head that is until let s call this trip trip happen after years of being okay and stable trip happened i had a full blown anxiety attack after having too much stress doing things i didn t wanna do i completely lost it i had a major anxiety panic attack and completely destroyed the wall i had build up in my mind to keep it tame it destroyed me and did a lot of damage because it brought back all the fear tremendous fear that i had over come over the years and even tho i m much older now that fear has really impacted me drastically this past and half months since trip happen i ve had many small moments where i feel not in control and i have that feeling of fear in everything i do i tried drinking to help me with the fear thinking i will over come it that way but instead it made it worse it had stopped me from going out and trying out things like i used to when i was stable and i miss it i don t take medication because i don t like the need to depend on any drugs to make me live a happy life i always see it as well what did people back then used when there weren t all these pharmacies with all this prescribed medication anyways i m here to say that i m building my way back up and it s not easy it s never easy but i would to say that for those who are suffering you are okay we are okay even when we feel bat shit crazy and feel like we are loosing our minds we are okay it s all in our heads we can t let it control us we can t let it stop us from living a true happy stable life not only are we going to suffer but so is our love ones in the long run we can t just say i give up when it starts giving us bad thoughts and the fear is there we can t feed it i love myself i love my family and despite this breakdown i will over come it like i did then everything happens for a reason not only has trip made me realize it s there but it made me realize that i ve lived wrong for many years i did a lot of things that were not okay just to please it and have it not over power me i stoped myself from living just so i wouldn t have a it moment i m here to say i m okay i am fine and if you re going through it always okay remember we are okay we are okay it s just a moment fear is only fear if we let it be fear there s nothing we can t do i believe everyone can over calm this no matter how bad it is as long as we as individuals believe we can do it we can do it we will do it good luck to everybody out there always remember just because we have a bad day doesn t mean tomorrow will also be bad stay positive,anxiety

0.32066324,14.264411,suggestions on how to defeat gad hi all so i have been dealing with gad or what appears to most likely be gad for the past years i am btw i am sure anyone here can attest to how annoying and depressing anxiety can be when it prevents you from doing things you want to enjoy i am going to give you guys the tldr version by saying that my anxiety did not really start until i took too much adderall one day and had a panic attack bc of it ever since then i have been dealing with anxiety my most common symptoms include dizziness trouble breathing hyperventilation and dry mouth sometimes if my anxiety is really bad i will start to go into panic by thinking something is wrong with me i ca not escape and that i am about to pass out or die so not very fun lol over the past year i have been taking cbd on and off which has actually been very helpful my only concern with cbd is if there are any long term repercussions i also recently started sessions with a therapist and psychiatrist to discuss ways in dealing or curing my anxiety i recently tried taking mg of zoloft and mg of buspar not at the same time but both gave me ed problems which i am not about either lol recently i have thought about doing some type of cleansing diet by cutting out all forms of caffeine and maybe alcohol in order to give me some type of areset i have also been wondering around on the inner webs wondering if there is a way to tell if you have a chemical imbalance in your brain that is a thing right i have been told by some doctors that it is a thing and that taking medication could be a way of are balancing your brain chemistry not sure if that is possible let me know what ya will think so i am reaching out to see what methods anyone has used to help them combat or cure their gad or whatever form of anxiety you have i understand everyone is different but i would like to get some ideas thanks in advanced,anxiety

16.151114,38.38512,maybe it was not exactly a vivid dream a couple month ago i made a post about how i remembered having what seemed like psychotic thoughts the night before i was trying to go to sleep but i heard these somewhat alien sounding voices coming from near my bed they looked like tall shadows in the dark room i could not understand them but they were there they seemed to be periodically making comments towards me in addition to speaking to eachother but i was terrified to respond thinking this does not make sense over and over i even remembered them speaking to my so who was right outside the door at the computer and hearing him responding to them in english i asked him if he was talking to anyone and he seemed confused for a second and then said no i shut my eyes and held a pillow over my head telling myself it could not be real and that it would not go away until i fell asleep the next morning i asked my so if he remembered me asking him if he was talking to someone and he said no i told him the rest of what happened and how i was terrified that i would reached psychosis again i was becoming more and more unstable at the time and within a week was put on disability he told me over and over that it was just a nightmare but it felt so real to me i fought my instinct and told myself and my pdoc that it must have just been been a dream based on what he said then last night it came up in conversation i have had some more paranoid unusual imagery around bed time while manic lately and always wake my so up to have him confirm its not real i told my so how it still felt real to me i remember every detail then he thought about it and said actually now that i think about it you seemed like you were having trouble falling asleep and you tried to say something to me a couple times but you were all seroqueled so i could not make it out so i took a guess and said something like uhhh no does anyone else have weird paranoid sometimes a little psychotic thoughts imagery before bed while on fairly high amounts of seroquel right now i take of the regular at night and of the xr during the day in addition to lithium trileptal and klonopin it is starting to freak me out that i keep being at least somewhat conscious and seeing shit at night especially when seroquel should be preventing that,bipolar

-38.173058,16.554758,fears about my therapist and everything else ever i have already posted here about my therapist having not very accurate views on bpd i thought this past week went better somewhat even though at one point when i was talking about work which has been a major stressor for me for a long time and an unfair situation i had dealt with there she said you are young so let me explain a few things about the working world i am and have been working in shitty retail jobs since i was actually today however i was having a hard time because my bf was not coming home from work when i thought he was because he wanted to do some other stuff the quality time we have gotten together lately has been a lot of fights and tension so i was upset by this i decided the proactive thing to do was call the therapist and set up my next appointment i had been crying and was talking very quietly on the phone it seems to me that it should have been obvious that i was upset but we did not figure out an appointment time and she did not ask me how i was or what was going on at all i called back and got voicemail left a message asking if i could email her because i was having a really hard time idk the thought of tryng to look for a therapist again is unbearable i was doing okay but now i feel like i am slipping back down feeling like everything is hopeless and no one really cares about me and life is so unfair i just do not want to bother and i am all alone i feel like it would just further burden my bf to talk to him i do not feel like i have friends my family does not understand i just want to take pills until i do not feel like this anymore i am so sick of never being happy or normal i ca not do it anymore,bpd

13.997444,35.51619,insecurity and romance so back in middle school i was the socially awkward kid who hung out with his socially awkward squad and did socially awkward things high school seemed to work out better for me i was able to work up the courage to socialize more and improved my skills with that practice people seemed to like me it was pretty good but recently around january i made some bad romantic decisions that spread as things unfortunately do in high school and my social life completely fell apart people stopped talking to me blocked me on social media stopped saying hi when we walked past each other it sucked my best friend in the world whom i trust with everything and he the same with me started hanging out with other people more than with me and as soon as i had that thought i realized something i am insecure my insecurity is what trashed my relationships not rumors i must have unconsciously sabotaged my relationships with people out of my own insecurity a good friend of mine part of the few that i can tell still genuinely like me and who is also still very much involved with the socially awkward group told me today that he lost his virginity a short while ago and i am immensely proud of him for having the courage to take that step in his life and for knowing what he wants but a part of me is jealous likely the same part that houses the insecurity and i hate it i hate how i ca not just be happy for my friend without feeling like i am inferior and failing at my social life i have never been able to find a romantic partner that could work long term i met a guy on reddit a few months ago but he lived too far away to sustain a long term relationship people tell me i am attractive irl primarily but also on my post on r amisexy and yet it is impossible to find anyone who is even on the same end of the rainbow as i am let alone attracted to me and yet everyone else around me is falling in love has lively social lives and just seems so much happier than i am i never get invited to people is plans and i often spend the weekends alone in my room on reddit or googling pointless bullshit i feel like my insecurity and my inability to cultivate a healthy social life platonically romantically and sexually are likely intertwined which is why i am addressing them together in the same post but any help for either issue would be much appreciated thank you for taking the time to read this,depression

-3.0286744,32.959106,teachers stalking me so my mom paid a doctor to give me a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder when i was six years old this diagnosis has trailed after me for nine years note that i disagree with it immensely but my mom wo not let me ask my gp for a second opinion until next year basically i need to tell someone about this and i need support so when i came home from school today i found a letter in the kitchen i figured out that it was an annual report about my asd behaviour the start of this letter was basically a detailed summary of a recent interview it remarks that i was agitated and did not make eye contact and sighed excessively and could not maintain my composure which are ridiculous nitpicks i never consented to be there especially on short notice this interviewer went as far as to complain that i tried to turn the pages of a book that she wanted to turn and she was unhappy that i seemed frustrated that she told me to slow down this is all because of my autism of course not the fact that i explicitly stated at the start that i was busy and she was encroaching on my time at one point she said teaching assistants are very helpful from my experience this is not true so i laughed a bit fast forward to the present day and apparently i laugh randomly according to this report basically every other part of the report said that i was distractable or attentive which are complete opposites at different intervals it said that my hygiene is awful which is true because i am depressed and passively suicidal hours per day it said that i was disorganised i do not even mind these notes but then the report went as far as to claim that i just did not understand these special issues the last part said that i neither want nor value social interaction which is nonsense not once did they ask me for my opinions they have just been spying on me they remark that i am too blunt and dismissive and easily upset by changes i e no i do not want to go to an interview that i did not mf consent to in order to do stupid goddamn puzzles for two hours when i could be learning now this is the kicker they went as far as to comment on my routes to class my diet and my interactions being too asocial so they are clearly spying on me i just want to ask for a second opinion from my gp and call it a day because the only reason this is a thing is because they think that i am autistic when i am not but my mother wo not let me get a new diagnosis for another six months and i feel like i am slowly losing my mind here i just want to curl up into a ball and wither away at this point i have been feeling too drained and emotionally exhausted to cry for hours edit yes literally any kind of sympathetic response is appreciated i have felt dead inside for ten hours now,depression

-41.446945,21.764622,i ca not be myself hi everyone i think i was depressed since i was years old or around that i was raised in a normal loving family it seems and i still have a good contact with my parents they were unfortunately always disbelieving my problems and sometimes even got frustrated by my behaviour i was too to be honest now i am taking medication but the problem does not go away i do not remember much but i was a happy content child and still inside i feel these need of being with people and being open fun and so on i am like that when i feel good but then depression strikes again and i return to being this weird person who does not talk and just wants to run back to bed these mood swings destroy my life even when i get to know new people and make some friends after some time this bad feeling returns and i seem like a totally different person uptight withdrawn ca not talk and so on it makes me lose all the people that i like or care about when this feeling passes and i am back my happy self or after a few mood swing like that people simply ditch me i suppose they start to think i am angry or sth and just distance themselves thanks to that at years old i have no childhood friends no friends from school or not many friends from uni with the couple of friends i have now i feel constant stress they will leave me too i am scared they will find out it is only them and i have no one to talk to or meet up with besides them so i pretend that i text with someone or make up stories about how much fun i had with my friends on weekend it is stupid i know i even have nightmares that i am that bad version o myself and ca not be myself and all people go away from me thing is i do not understand what is going on with me and i am not even sure if i am describing it correctly i can be myself some days but others i just lose control over that and it destroys everything in my life it also impacts other areas in my life like studying work health and personal care and most important thing i do not believe that therapy and talking about it will help i really do not i have read books forums and so on tried various techniques on relaxation confidence i take up new hobbies like martial arts etc but nothing helps i do not thing a simple change of my outlook on things will help my problem it is become especially hard recently because i am back to thinking something happened in my childhood that made me like that i am not sure if it is ok to write it here but i am even more scared to tell anyone in real life about it when i was around years old i remember i had a weird dream about someone i know sexually molesting me around that time i became a bit of a loner and i was kind of obsessed about sex i had weird fetish about breasts which my strange dream included i was playing with my dolls in that way or writing words connected with sex in my notebook but was always scared about it and throwing the pages away i also remember as if one day everything changed i was very scared of people even my own family and started to behave in weird ways in kindergarten i was pretending i do not speak or sitting in a corner and watching children play when before i had some friends there i was scared of contact with my family or simply seeing my aunt uncle cousin and telling them a simple hi i just want to be myself i am planning to go to therapist soon because that is the only thing i have left but i have so many doubts about it maybe someone will have some advice for me especially if stuff i say make sense i would appreciate anything really,depression

2.4007714,41.24775,let is sum my years of bs hello thanks for reading this in my years of life i believe my suicidal thoughts came around th grade in elementary school i was about to fail a year so i decided to stay quiet about it and try to fix it when the teacher said that i am going to fail for sure i decided to go home and try to take my life in the bathroom i told one of my best friends at the time about it and he literally pulled me out of it almost beating me to a crap so i chickened out and decided to study a lot lot when all the kids stayed home or w e in summer i was going to school with the i have to help my friend is family excuse my parents did not suspect a thing well guess what i did not fail hooray for me well i decided to not talk about that incident and some months passed until my mom asked the friend is mother with what i was helping with damn afterwards i have had to confess everything and i was beaten and cursed at when i said but why would you beat me up i did not fail i got but wh t f y u f il d for an answer wow okay i have not been abused during the elementary school everyone loved me and i loved everyone if i can say so we had a lot of quarrels in family but nothing too serious and it all would end up in a hugs and laughter never had any big of a problem to talk about with my family so i always kept everything to myself i had easy going life without a care in this world high school same thing except yeha you guessed it puberty i was growing and i started to notice in what kind of shit i live in and live with i stared hating my parents for not understanding me so i started talking about my grandpa about it he was fully understanding me and supporting me so i would usually complain about parents to him and grandma i have never liked my grandma actually when i think about it so i usually quarreled with her a lot that is when the problems started whenever i was complaining to grandpa about mom and dad she would show up saying it is all my fault so i would attack her verbally and my grandpa would defend me too i loved my grandpa so much at the time my grandpa was and still is an alcoholic but i failed to notice that at the early age of mine things escalated quickly between me and grandma so much that i would insult her with everything i could think about she would do the same thing and she would everytime tell my father about it everytime i say something unnecessary in quotas cause everything i say is irrelevant to my family to grandma i would get beaten up by dad that continues even today with the beatings i would often be called idiot stupid that i wo not ever be getting a gf job or family typical verbal abuse still present with the each year passed the higher the pressure everyone around me got older and non tolerable to my jokes and little pranks i would get verbally and physically abused every day for years literally everyday i stopped going to the grandad cause i noticed that he is become same as my dad boring demanding and always expecting a lot of me at the age of i started arguing with him and my grandma decided it is a good time to call my dad again so i could get a nice fresh beating about my mother i ca not say anything that bad except she wo not listen at all when ever i talk with her about anything tho she defended me couple of times and that is it those everyday verbal and physical treatments has drastically changed the way i think and act in my life friends of mine would usually call me a child they would wish for quiet and good behaving and all that mainstream bs i have never spoke to anyone about my problems until today and everytime someone would ask do i have any sort of problems i would often brush it of with a laughter i started to hate everyone and i freely told them that in the face we hate you too more than anything ok even though they deny the truth i know it is true based on their everyday actions during those years everyone changed a lot i finally graduated and decided to skip on college for one year i found a nice job and i was really excited about it i am still doing the same same job for almost a year now it is not particularly bad nor it is good do not get me wrong but it is a job and the salary is acceptable for my needs only not enough cash to spare with everyone once i got my first salary i had only one goal in my mind brand new pc i finished it recently after like months of hard work my parents asked for half of my money always arguing about it and kept saying that it is a waste of money and that i should give everything to them so it was tiresome and loooong journey but eventually i finished it i was so happy i remember when i ordered the graphic card which was like half of my money i got a beating for not consulting about it and almost made to give up on it and whenever i would say stuff like hey i earned this money fair and square i would get the usual answer we did everything for you all these years you have been born because of us and now it is the time you pay us back you are going to live on your own and you wo not return home until you pay the worst thing is that even my grandparents decided to assault me once me and grandpa decided to get a dog cause our previous one has died poor dog he was my only friend and family we would split the cost of everything and that is how we agreed boy i was wrong not only i have to give money for all kinds of stuff i now have another mouth to feed and believe me this labrador can eat a lot and i have to get medicines for him it is not hard for me to pay stuff like vaccines and food but i felt betreyed so i decided to confront my grandpa we yelled at each other and soon my father was by the door ready to beat me up you want my parents dad ha you useless piece of crap we hate you i hope you never find happiness i answered with clenched fist and i yelled yes i want you all dead soon i got hit with a bottle i bled countless of times but decided to just brush it off i started praying that something kills me but i gave up on that after couple of months with nothing to kill me i started to be a shut in hard core gamer and that was abother thing to get abused for i am good for nothing once i think they were debating that i am a gay for not having a girlfriend or going out guess they are homophobic i was finding a joy in games and youtube whenever i would laugh at some funny memes i would have been called a freak and ready for mental hospital nowadays i usually spend time in my room keeping contacts with my grandparents to minimum today my grandma barged in her way to my room and started looking at me creepily i closed my door and got a beating for doing that dad even broke my pc mouse which i bought with my own money i mean who gives him a right to do that it is not his anything i bought i bought with my own money which i earned legally evetyime i start defending myself i get beaten up and verbally abused well that is it if i missed

-39.366325,25.687393,it is all for nothing today is not a good day i had a bad day yesterday too but hell every day for the last years has been some shade of depressed i have not worked or been in school for nearly years now and i ca not see any sort of future when i look into my future all i see is a massive terrifying black hole of nothing an abyss so deep that i dare not approach it yet i know i must for i have no choice in the matter or do i suicide always seems like the prudent option it makes sense if it is all for nothing why bother living i ca not imagine any sort of career that would give my life meaning or fulfill me or even if i can that career either does not exist or is not achievable for me i am on permanent disability for my depression that is so hard to get that means someone saw my application looked over all the evidence and said wow this chick is fucked and there is a good chance she will never get better i have been consistently in treatment since i was i have taken so many drugs talked through probably thousands of hours of therapy right now i have therapy for hours a week in my cbt group they talk about how depression wants us to say why bother and we should ignore it but how how can i ignore something i so genuinely believe and that seems obviously true it honestly feels like everyone else is living in a delusion not me everyone else somehow manages to lie to themselves enough that their lives have meaning i do not have that talent i am not knocking those people in any way i wish i did have that talent but i find it hard to believe i am ever going to be able to convince myself that everything i have gone through was for any sort of reason and i find it hard to believe i am ever going to be able to convince myself that this depression i am experiencing has nothing to do with how the world really is that it is all an irrational delusion in my head that cbt tells me it is the world is an objectively sad and horrifying place people are selfish and awful to each other and prejudice poisons everything capitalism teaches us that we have to just work and work and then eventually after years of working as a faithful cog in the system you finally get to die with nothing accomplished and no meaning to your existence that is your reward and people lie to themselves and say that hard work is so important well maybe it is in a vacuum but in this world hard work is what makes you a sucker your hard work and your insistence on that as a moral stance is what allows others to take advantage of you and bleed you dry no one cares about you especially if there is something wrong with you like a disability like depression they would all just as soon let you die by cutting your access to social programs by letting you be homeless by letting you be sick and helpless in the same breath they will be the same ones telling you not to kill yourself because suicide is selfish and for cowards even as they practically celebrate your death knell i am just disgusted by almost everyone and more and more convinced that humanity is a stain on the history of this planet and everything will be better off with us gone me included i take part in the oppression and pain of others on this planet by default living in a rich western nation i take from the hands and mouths of the poorest nations on earth i benefit from the subjugation of hundreds of millions and there is nothing i can even do about it so many would be angry with me for even saying this but that is only because they know it is true and they could not see themselves the same way if they accepted its truth we accept narratives and delusions to protect ourselves from the truth of who we really are and i just do not think i can do it anymore and i do not see how cognitive restructuring is supposed to help me deal with the fact that our world is fundamentally fucked up it seems like just more bullshit being fed to us by the medical establishment to make us believe these lies because they secretly know that that is the only way to live with ourselves is to lie about our true nature sorry this is so long i know it is basically thought vomit but it is all i can see right now and for once i do not want to be told that i am irrational everywhere there is suffering and a great deal of it is my fault directly or indirectly i do not see how that is not just the truth and if getting better involves lying to myself i do not know that i ever will i am just not good at it thanks for reading if you made it this far,depression

5.414566,40.958473,this might seem cliche but i hate my life for the record i was diagnosed with depression and am currently on wellbutrin for it i seems like every day is the worst day of my life and when anything good happens life decides to throw twice as many bad things at me i will list some good things first i am a fairly intelligent guy and was accepted to a well respected engineering school while at school i co op would with the same company times and they want me to come back for a th there is a good chance they will hire me after i graduate my parents are weird but they care about me alot i have hobbies that give me immense satisfaction i am a house music dj and also a music producer i also program games in my free time and like to learn about cosmology and philosophy yeah i am a bit of a nerd despite all of that i feel hollow and empty inside i am years old and my longest relationship lasted week because i realized i liked the idea of a relationship and not her whenever i actually like a girl it ends horribly and this is actually what caused me to write this the relationships always start out with the girl liking me and then it seems like when i start liking her she stops liking me normally i find making friends fairly easy and even though i can be socially awkward i am fairly easy to get along with once you get to know me it seems like the only time a girl likes me is when i am not into her i have had sex twice with these kinds of girls and it always ends badly not because i am bad at it but because i just did not get into it and i lose my erection fairly quickly i have anxiety issues and me losing my erection those times has made me question whether there is something wrong with me or not although it is probably just performance anxiety i have been working on myself for years by dressing well having good hygiene working out getting better at my hobbies and trying to get rid of my depression and anxiety i am also not a bad looking guy and do notice interest from girls my life has been terrible for as long as i can remember when i was a kid i had crippling shyness and social anxiety i barely had friends and even got in a fight just because a guy did not like me at the time i was pretty wimpy so i got my ass kicked later on i started acting out and as a result my best friend said that he would stop hanging out with me if i did not calm down because my disruptions were causing him to do poorly in school then we moved to a completely different state and i had to start over and the shyness and social anxiety became overwhelming the closest i got to a girl in high school was me calling a girl i liked and asking her out only to get denied every time after awhile it became pretty easy for me to make and gain friends so that definitely helped alot when i went to college things seemed alright i mean i did not know anybody and was still super shy but it was a slight improvement being around more intelligent and technically minded people my first semester i met a girl in my dorm we did not really know eachother until one day she started flirting and we ended up cuddling and making out for like hours before i had to go back and get some sleep the next day she tells me that it meant nothing and i was crushed it turns out she is probably the most terrible person i know others agree and she continuously uses people and is probably a sociopath later on i met the girl that i had a week long relationship with and there was not much to that later i meet this really cool smart talented independent girl and i get a huge crush on her i end up taking her out dancing sleep over at her place i acted really awkward and then a few days later took her out on a date where i did not kiss her bad move later on i find out she fell in love with another guy in a different state a few months ago and did not tell me she just wanted attention and was completely self centered i was devastated now for more current things i was devastated for awhile and my gay friend told me about this girl he hung out with before he transfered to my school he said we would get along great and she was my type although she is bipolar it turns out he was right we started talking and hit it off unfortunately she went to school hours away so i could not really do anything so for the next year or so we go through periods of flirting talking and periods of barely any contact last semester she decided to bring a few friends to my school so we could go dancing i had an amazing time and we ended up dancing together we met up a few times since then and i could seriously talk to her for hours i felt we really connected recently she graduated and got a job in the town i go to college which i felt awesome about she is a big star wars nerd so i started calling her leia which she really liked i thought her personality fit anyways i talk to her today and told her call me han solo and be my valentine leia which i thought she would really like afterwards i get a long message about how she thought of me as a friend and did not really feel that spark and whatever i told her goodbye because i could not keep this going anymore i promptly deleted her from facebook and deleted her number i really felt like we could have had something i know we had our moments but i think she is impulsive and the distance kinda ruined it for her i know at one point she did have feelings for me i feel so shitty right now i keep waiting for the day where life wo not suck so much but it never comes i keep trying new things and bettering myself but it does not work i am not suicidal sorry if this is really long but i felt i needed to add detail thanks,depression

-38.83275,28.783033,the time has finally come and i know what to do hi guys i think it is about time i have lived for so long with no idea why and with absolutely no desire to see tomorrow even in my best of times i have not had one single moment in over a decade where i felt like i would not trade that moment for a quiet permanent respite from it all i have been a fool blinded by a desire to be normal i have put all these people around me i have confided in some of them i have treated them well i have been treated well etc i have made friends gotten close to family all that jazz it is too much i have no strength left to give them most people feel depression or suicidal thoughts in waves up and down me i have felt it as a constant pain in my side spiking occasionally but never going away i have only ever been able to dull the pain never cure it but because i was simultaneously blinded by some nieve pursuit of a life free from self hatred i ignored the very real implications of bringing my loved ones into my world i have obligated myself to them and yet i have no will left to continue to live for them i will never regret anything more than i regret opening myself up to these people while failing to realize how it would ultimately hurt them but now the haze has cleared and i am more sure now of what to do than ever i am over all the self loathing crap and i am in a totally clear minded spot now i know what i should do what i must do it is become very very obvious to me that i will kill myself i have not decided when or how but it is a certainty at this point i have increasingly felt that whatever ties i have left to this world are the only things keeping me here imagining the people i will hurt is the only thing that has willed me to come off the edge of the building or put the cap back on the bleach bottle coming so close so many times it was their faces that i could not get out of my head that is why i have come up with a plan it is a two part plan because the only hurdle i have left to clear is how i am going to leave this world without honestly devastating the people i will leave here the first part of my plan is called operation asshole it is a straightforward plan i am going to become an asshole i will ignore all contact with people i will be nasty i will make and spread rumors destroy friendships whatever i have to do to get the people i care about away from me i hope upon hope that by doing this eventually those same people will feel hatred or indifference instead of guilt for what i will do there is nothing worse than feeling guilty for the death of a loved one that is something i know very very personally i will save them from that curse if they have to hate me for it to work i will bear that for them it is the least i can do for those that have no choice but to stick with me i will do my best to explain my thoughts my cousin when he made his choice to leave this life did not leave a note that was honestly one of the worst parts about it no explanations just questions and heartache i ca not do that i have a note that i wrote almost years ago it is saved on my laptop right where i meant for my roommate to find it although my plan then was just to simply disappear somewhere where no one would ever find me i read that note a few days ago as i do occasionally and i realized it is no longer pertinent to my situation you see in that note i made grandiose gestures about how sorry i was and frankly i bitched and moaned like the teenager i was i blamed people i blamed society i blamed myself i left a lengthy diatribe about reaching out to the fringe elements the people who you may not realize need your help the most i tried to express my pain but i realize now i should have tried to explain it you see my new note will be a totally different approach in that note i will explain myself straightforward and now completely devoid of the anger i felt back then i no longer have the strength to be angry just calm that i finally understand what i have to do people ca not seem to understand that being me and living my life is akin to having a disability it is like constant pain except no one see measure or understand it but me people do not get mad at people with cancer who decide to go peacefully right then why must i suffer anymore i have literally never felt so clear and level headed in my life i am making a rational and conscious decision to do what i am doing and i really truly hope that the people around me will accept it when i tell them it is truly what i want and that none of them could have ever affected the outcome people need to understand the magnitude of my sickness that way they can hopefully understand or at least sympathize with my decision i know this is not a foolproof plan but it is the closest i can possibly imagine getting to minimizing the damage to those around me there will be no way to completely eliminate the pain that i will cause but it is time that i come to accept that as fact and move on to what i can control oddly i am really at peace for the first time in ages i do not feel anxiety or melancholy about my life i am able to finally sit and enjoy the small things because i have finally accepted and embraced what will ultimately happen it is given my brain a reprieve from all the darkness so that i can map out and initiate my plan it is as if my whole life is now finally working in sync towards the same goal i have learned to let go i hope those who care about me can ultimately learn to do so as well it is simply my time and i understand that now my lifetime of pain and suffering is coming to a close and at least this final chapter will bring some clarity and closure once again reddit i am pouring out my self into a wall of words for you to read or not i still do not know why i did it or what will come of it for some reason i felt like utilizing my clarity of conscious to type out my plan sort of puts it into stone perhaps i want someone to eventually find this and use it as a reminder that i really was sane perhaps sick in mind and spirit but sane enough to understand what i was doing again i do not know all i know is that it is time and i have never felt better,depression

-0.63308674,32.608913,something that has always bothered me about suicide whenever suicide became a topic i would always wonder why that person felt like they needed to die death is a guarantee as far as i am aware so why would someone who was feeling down chose death earlier than it needed to be x b well today i feel like i really know why x b i have been pretty unhappy for the last year unemployed and broke getting scraps from the government to cover rent and food things are looking up though i have a brand new really good job starting in a few days i am working on writing my second album for a band i am in i play local gigs from time to time and i have a few friends in the scene x b but last night i was overcome by this paralyzing feeling that i am unhappy and a new job or writing music wo not fulfill my happiness despite the promise of a new full time job to keep me busy i remembered how many decent jobs i have had before and how they always ended the same way x b the strong feeling of unhappiness is actually not new for me it probably started when i was a teenager this morning the feeling was still there when i woke up usually i can block it out or it goes away the feeling is more intense each time i think because of the older i am getting and the more time i am wasting the feeling is so intense this time that i think i finally understand why suicide is so common x b i know the reason i am unhappy is because i compromise who i am in order to fit in with my environment society friends family etc i withhold my feelings in order to please others and not upset people and also to create an image of myself that i can control and can be respected x b getting a job and paying rent is the way the world works i know that i have been playing that game for a while now trying to be an adult my problem is i do not care about survival this encumbering feeling tells me that i am going to die some day that death is a guarantee and surviving to a ripe old age just to look back and say to myself hell i did not really do what i wanted to do i just followed the rules is not worth the trip x b so i figure i have got two alternatives suicide attack the fear that lives inside me head on forget the past and the future live for the moments i am in and find a way to enjoy each one x b number sounds easy enough but because of the kind of person i am it involves going against everything that society teaches me to be i would have to stop worrying about what other people thought of me if i decided to steal something i would have to be okay with people saying i have gone crazy and i am no longer myself i would tell people how i felt and they might hate me for it my friends would probably try to forget about me my parents would be ashamed of me i could get a police record i could go to jail i might not be able to pay rent i might become homeless if those are my fears how do i simply block them out x b even though i have never been able to and still ca not answer that question my only motivation to keep trying is to avoid taking my own life x b thanks for reading please leave me some comments or feedback i know i am not alone feeling like this i feel like i have no one to talk to about my thoughts and feelings at least no one that feels the way i do so i would really appreciate meeting some other people here and hearing what you all have to say x b thanks x b,depression

to verify that i had understood everything or to see if i had missed anything and this in turn affected every other area books movies retarded actions etc even the most trivial things i can have a hard time understanding everything from single sentences to contexts i will try to post some examples later that are made up or when i encounter something that should be easy to comprehend i also tend to re read things over and over obviously when i do not understand something but when i do as well it feels like i have a lack of focus during the condition while suffering from the condition i have a tendency to explain things i see read or hear even though i understand it this is something i can combat by saying to myself if you understand do not explain or fuck it you understand move on sometimes it works sometimes it does not so i have control over this aspect more or less but what i ca not control is my ability to understand things if i drink alcohol or smoke cannabis during the condition i feel normal again when sobering up i might feel normal for a couple of days until the condition returns either as strong as before or even worse so it seems as if video games that are story based drugs and other things triggers it when it began two years ago i later came to the conclusion that it was cannabis that triggered it and therefore i did not smoke for months but during that period it came and went anyway then i smoked again and it did not trigger it the condition varies in it is nature the only two consistent aspects is what i have explained above sometimes i do lots of stupid things like placing bread in the fridge not really a bad example but it will do or other stupid practical things that i either just do in a retarded way or in a unnecessarily complicated way worse memory as well another thing which almost never happens during the condition anymore and if it does i just tell myself to stop is that i used to count and think about retarded things i had done during the day i also have a harder time phrasing myself which is evident in this post repeating words not using the most optimal words also noticed that the more i think about it the worse it gets i have been thinking about writing about this for several months now but i did not want to do it when i was free from the condition out of fear that it would return or i did not do it during the condition because i was too lazy or indifferent when the condition appears after a period of being normal i get scared and think thoughts like not again no no why and other things and i try to shake it off sometimes it works but sometimes it is like i am thinking about various things related to the condition even if i am not like it is in the background even if i am actually thinking about whatever i have talked about it with a psychologist and she said that i appear observative analytical etc i continued talking about it during every meeting and finally she said ok then maybe you are stupid right now but it wo not last forever it is probably a phase you are going through right now because of stress but i do not feel stressed another thing is that i never think about anything philosophical anymore i only think about trivial banal matters like what i should to tomorrow which movie i should watch when friends start talking about serious matters like politics psychology or whatever i can jump into the discussion and make arguments i have always been interested in intellectual subjects like history psychology crimonology etc i do not form opinions anymore when reading something in a newspaper which i rarely do or a forum i do not think as deeply as before and i do not reflect as much this is present regardless if i am affected by the condition or not but during the condition it is probably less reflection and deep thinking than otherwise i am however very self aware which not only i have concluded but others as well because i can reflect a lot about myself am i suffering from a psychosis if not what is it or have my brain become damaged in some way and i will just have to accept it and live with it thing is if it would be a psychosis or some kind of disease why does it vary it just sounds illogical that it would be anything like that because of the irregularity if the condition would have been affecting me every day i would probably have killed myself this morning i experienced my first real suicide thought since the depression i had years ago because of it is irregular nature i still have some hope i said in the beginning of the post that i would try to be as short and concise as possible well this is not short nor concise but it is the best i can do i could add a lot more examples experiences and stuff than i already have i am sincerely grateful for replies chris,depression

-41.8595,20.794027,do not know where to begin i do not really know where to begin or how to put this down in words but here goes nothing apologize for the wot i have been feeling down and depressed on and off for the past years some days are ok maybe even good but that is usually because i have not had time to stop and think whenever i let go of my mind i always dive straight into a pit of regret doubt and anxiety i do have a job that i am happy with i like most of my coworkers and the work itself is alright sometimes i feel like i would rather be at work than at home and i guess that is pretty rare but i m starting to think i may like it because it distracts me from my feelings also i ca not help to think that i should be finishing school and go to the university instead of working that is what almost all my childhood friends are doing and i feel like my time is running out at the same time i feel like me and my old friends are growing apart we do not see each other as much and our interests does not really match anymore that may not be unusual but it makes me unsure of the future i have made new friends at work but we do not really hang out other than at work i find it difficult to take those relationships to the same level i had with my childhood friends i also do not really have any interests anymore i used to play a lot of sports when i was younger i had a break for a few years but picked it back up again a couple of years ago now i seem to have lost interest again i used to like gaming but i ve lost interest in that too i have tried learning the guitar and have come quite far since i started but my motivation for that seem to have died out as well however what probably bothers me the most is the fact that i am a year old virgin and i have never had a girlfriend in my entire life not even close i am not ugly but i have obviously done something wrong i just ca not put my finger on what it drives me crazy and i hate myself for it wherever i go and whatever i do i always get reminded of it out in public in movies even music it s love and relationships everywhere yet i m so far from it i feel like i will never find anyone and it is not exactly getting easier as i grow older in this case time really is running out it seems many people feel like shit but many of them still have a partner in life it makes me really sad that i do not i just ca not imagine it working out for me ever on top of it all i kind of feel like an ungrateful pos for feeling like i do my family have always been supportive but i find it difficult to give back most of the time i don t want anything to do with them i have not encountered many difficulties growing up besides my own thoughts i mean people struggle with all kinds of hardships like drugs and abuse or whatever in comparison my life seem so easy i can t justify my feelings and i feel like i ve wasted the opportunities that i ve had i remember looking into the future with plans and high hopes but somehow my motivation to do anything just disappeared i just do not know how to live life it seems i would not say i am suicidal but i would be lying if i said it never crossed my mind i have tried therapy but it does not seem to work the feelings always come back sooner or later it s been so long now i m tired and i am lonely again sorry for the wot just had to get some of it off my chest even though it barely scratches the surface if you made it this far thank you for your time,depression

-39.28449,26.698515,why i think love does not exist in this generation i will start off by saying i am a year old male you might go ahead in the comments and furiously start typing i did not experience the world in my short span of life but i have dated and experienced a lot of relationships that i feel i could say this with confidence might sound a bit bias because this my own experience but what i noticed in my failed relationships in my life is that people have short attention span you might wonder why this is important but it really is you can sleep for hrs and end up single these days the internet has developed the new generation in such a way that they lack the idea of long term gratification since this is my opinion take it with a grain of salt but i am sad i am very sad because i ca not tell if this is a trait of being mentally immature or a common trait of my generation accronyms are so common click bait titles like the one i have is so common as well as fast information is common there was a few cases to where if i did not text a few exs fast enough they will think i am not giving enough attention not knowing i have a full life with events going on concurrent to their emotions this led me to an emphany that maybe love is all about being fast i am not sonic and i think this is detrimental to humanity future birth rates at lowering the girls i date are very short tempered and fast i would think this is just me if i did not date girls from many different cultures and environments with totally different backgrounds and relationship between people there is no way that it is a coincidence for me to choose people with those same traits or them to choose me and then exhibit them same traits i even went out of my way to date a few people i would not originally find attractive in anyway to see if it will change my perception but as open minded as i tried to be it always ended with a difficulty in fast i gave information i am long winded i say a lot i think the more data the more perspective you can get it takes a while for me to think about things i think before i speak because i want things to go just right i need to plan stuff i am not very spontaneous i have a very stable personality that is pretty predictable this might be a key factor in the destruction of my relationships i thought but then i looked at others how come not only me but many other people ca not find love around my age bracket generation z people are shifting around not taking risks because of the danger it may bring towards their mental well being i think failure is needed for growth asking questions and etc so why do everyone simply keep shut and do not say their opinions or thoughts why is everyone afraid of offending someone and why is everyone not very clear on what they mean this might be a trait found in every generation but i feel like it reached an all time peak these days people are becoming shells to protect their selves at the same time they are shells who want constant fast attention information it is like a paradox how can you want lots of information and attention but only the one you feel is right it is like asking for space knowledge but do not want to learn physics because it is wack honestly the way this influence relationships between not only two people but family and friends is crazy the ghosting the ability to swipe and date ur perfect person instant gradifation at our finger tips this all of this is many reasons why i do not think love is do not exist in this generation even if it does it is just too small to be considered imo tldr i am sad i do not know if i will find love with this weird events happening in my generation my experience says i wo not and maybe no one will do i wait for growth of my generation or keep trying is my thinking wrong,depression

12.397958,33.248497,i feel like life is just getting worse last year on january of my mom died me only being at that time i feel like there was still much to do with my mom also being in my junior year of high school i really didn t have time to greave i knew i had to focus on school so that i could graduate and not be behind i suppressed these emotions and i didn t have a sufficient enough time to greave over her but everyday i would always think about her when something random happened passing by a place we used to go to get ice cream or some restaurant were they served milk tea and after school she would take me sometimes if she got off work early she would always make me my favorite food at least once a week and also cook everyday she was a super mom and always took care of me and my step dad her and my dad got divorced when i was just and i never got to grow up with a normal isela family i also never had any siblings so i was just an only child i felt lonely growing up and i feel lonely right now my mom had custody of me with visitation given to my dad i d only see him on weekends and i feel like i wasn t enough to have a bond with him through the end of middle school up to know i ve been trying to find a partner i ve always wanted a girlfriend and i tried and never really got anywhere until high school around elementary school i found my first love and i would do everything to get her attention and for her to like me we were really good friends because of this i d go everywhere with her and i would buy her gifts any time i could we even danced together at a school festival for cinco de mayo a sombrero with boots with a fake metal sword y un vestido de flores para ella for her it was cute and i feel in love with her until one day she broke my heart with a question she wanted to ask a boy if he liked her my heart broke i knew she only thought of us as friends and that s all we were going to be i think of it now and it seems to be the best thing that could ve been seeing as we were so young we knew nothing of love but this still made me break i couldn t function i even had to get therapy my parents thought it was from their separation but it was from this i suffer from finding love now i feel like i ll be forever lonely and i hate it i was always a mama s boy so i always loved my mom there is something about a mother s love that no one else can replicate i told her everything about me and my life she was my role model she did everything for me and she was good at everything now i lost her and i feel lost and lonelier than ever before i lost her and i can never see her again she never got to see me graduate my kids won t be able to see one of their grandmas i didn t get to take care of her or buy her a home and a car once she retired it hurts so much an indescribable pain i took a few weeks of of school and would talk to my mom who was know ashes in a pretty red vase representative of her and her favorite color when she was on that bed i don t know when exactly she died i don t know if she got to hear the things i needed to say to her before she went away forever my step dad even lied to me telling me she was getting better so i could go to school just for a bit more i still remember walking into her room and her not being able to speak asking for water but the doctors refused to give her some she had earrings on that they told me to hold onto until she got better and out of the hospital i know wear those earrings as a necklace with me everyday i have quite a few friends who surprisingly are all girls its easier to talk to them about emotions than my guy friends they re more immature and ignorant but still caring one of those friends was a girl i was with everyday i went with this girl everywhere to college trips to places to eat took her to stores to just look at stuff i offered her to buy things but she never wanted my money i m glad she always said that because i knew she cared about me and didn t want me spending money on her i fell in love with her sometimes i d skip class just to go to her house for a bit since she got out early but she started developing feelings for another guy this guy was in some dance practice she had that was for her family and this guy was some friend of her cousin s she would always talk about him always i eventually said ok clearly she s happier being around him than me and ultimately the only thing i wanted for her is to be happy so i contacted the guy and told her how i felt about her it was weird i m sure in his mind he was like who the hell is this guy and what right does he have to talk to me but i told him that my fiend liked him and that he makes her happy so to take this opportunity i asked him how he felt about her and he said he felt the same way after that i told him how i really felt about her too it was a weird situation but i became the better man and told him if he promised me he would take care of her and treat her with the most love and respect possible i would back down from this and give them the chance they deserved nothing is better than two people living each other she had a hard life usually cried to me about her problems i told her i will always be here for her i wouldn t give up on her even if she gave up herself it hurt at first but i got used to it or so i believed i felt so connected to her she even came to my moms funeral and went up with me holding my hand while a gave a eulogy and i m crying she was everything to me but i wanted her to be happy i tend to do things for other and out their happiness before mine but i now realize this is unhealthy for me time passes and i see her post her pictures with them kissing and going places and sometimes i m like i wish it could ve been me i leaned to accept this and move on while still being her friend now i see them together and i can t take it it makes me depressed i hoped that being in a relationship with her would fill this void in me after i

-45.02401,18.131577,honestly just letting out a little release and hoping it helps i have never been diagnosed with depression really i have never been diagnosed with anything i suppose i have one of those families that just we do not get checked out for anything not illness or various minor nuisances i have hardly been given much reason to put my faith in doctors my closest family member died to a complication in recovery from surgery and my own personal experience landed me in an er due to being told as a kid that i just had the summer flu i just do not like doctors or talking about problems to people maybe because of worrying about being judged or disliked even i do not really know it is just an extreme discomfort jump to now i am years old and really i just do not know what i want i have a job i am a college student mostly because it is something to do really i just do things to eliminate the constant moments of boredom that seem to plague my existence at some point i lost a passion for life now and then i get glimpses of it but it always seems surreal and fleeting and even then at the end of the day all i think is that it would be a perfect time to cease existing before it goes downhill before the good feelings disappear and sadly this is a happy thought for me i wo not end my life of course not because i do not particularly want to or some want to survive but because to even think about doing so brings so much tears and pain when i think about those around me my boyfriend my family my friends it would hurt them it would complicate life for them and i would make a nuisance of myself nuisance really that is what i hate the thought of being the thought of dragging people down or being in the way of their happiness more than once i have had to be reassured by friends or my boyfriend that i am not being a bother if i ask for something or do something for them and really i do not know where this all started either it feels like it is just always been there that i have always forced the plethora of interests just to have something to do that i have always pushed people away because i did not want to drag them into my existence and weigh them down and so i lack almost all social skills and people being around them for long periods of time make me uncomfortable but these are all things that i keep buried so deep inside me because it is hard to talk about and it is hard to do something about without talking about it even as i type this i happen to be crying and do not even know why or what i should feel about that so yeah i do not know i might add more to this as time goes on it was just something i felt that i should do just to talk into the vast chaos of the internet,depression

-40.541786,20.934761,what are the reasons you do not open up or tell people by the title i mean to the fullest extent i have told one or two people whom i think are probably friends of mine i ca not tell i never know the very very slightest bit of it all i just told them both that for a while i have been depressed no big deal i was not crying emotional none of that all casual of course this was a tiny tiny fraction of the whole thing i come up with fake conversations in my head a lot usually so i can practice a response to something that may come up in the future but sometimes i do it to compensate for being alone i do not have anyone besides my parents in real life to talk to recently for some reason i have had this thought about what i would do if one of the people whom i have told about the way i have been feeling said that they would always be there if i wanted someone to talk to and that i should talk to them and for the entire time i have thought about this fake situation i ca not come up with a response there is no way to tell them respectably no not that i do not appreciate their offer but it just would not work with me luckily for me i do not anticipate anyone ever offering me their time to talk about how i feel which is a good thing it would save me and the other person a ton of awkwardness simple list of why i do not intend on ever delving deep inside my feelings and talk with someone i have no way of knowing if they really care about what i say or just hear me out as a sort of social obligation or out of sympathy this is not something you can ask someone and have them say oh yeah come on i care there is simply no way of knowing if i say something along the lines of i feel like killing myself because nobody likes me and i never go out with anybody like everyone else does that would just be really inconsiderate of me i would now be putting this person in a position where they are now forced to go hang out with me or something or else they fear i would might kill myself like the reason above i have no way of knowing if they would actually enjoy my presence or are just doing it out of obligation additionally this creates a fake situation that would not have existed had i not opened up to this person what makes me any more worthy of being hung out with now that i have said i feel suicidal over the fact that nobody wants to do it with me nothing i never hung out with them or frankly anybody before they must have known this i feel like saying some things like this is not venting anymore it could be perceived as masking a way to ask someone if they would want to hang out which is not at all my intention if someone wants to be my friend or hang around me i would want it to be completely genuine and have no influence of any obligations save them the trouble honestly who the hell in their right mind wants to talk to me or care about how i feel it is very obvious at this point that it is nobody and there is a reason for that a reason i have yet to find maybe i just did not win the social lottery than seemingly everyone else has won i would just be annoying them sugar coating any nice person would do this this is not at all an attack on any theoretical person i would be talking to but i have no way of knowing if i say something like i think i deter everyone because i am an asshole just to be replied with you are a nice person is that true am i nice or are you just saying that to not upset an already upset person there is no winning this there is probably more reasons but those are the main ones in the fake conversation in my head i keep having there is no respectable way to explain why you would not want to do something that seemingly anyone else in your position would want to do to those who do seek help please do not feel ashamed this entire post is probably rooted from my anxiety and the result of me overthinking any situation that involves sociality good for you for seeking help i am glad for you either way my rant is over on to you i am asking r depression specifically those who do not seek help on why they choose not to i am curious why maybe i am not the only one who thinks like this or maybe i am oh well,depression

4.0315065,41.645752,people tell me to just get over it that is just how life works but is depression triggered by events i have always had small bouts of depression before the late summer of but nothing that lasted longer than a month but at the beginning of the fall semester i am a college student a sequence of events unfolded so quickly and so frequently that i have had to seek professional help to make sense of it all i will try to make this short and sweet but bitter is likely the better term here in september i found out that that my roommate and best friend took my girlfriend to a secluded place on our campus and tried to have sex with her my girlfriend and i had been dating for nearly months at the time and i trusted my friend above all of my others before that time when i found out i punched him in front of a large group of people and walked off that was that or so i thought two weeks later i saw a message pop up on my girlfriend is phone from someone who i knew to be a former interest of hers i was curious and opened the message and viewed their conversation i was appalled to find that she had initiated in a very sexually driven and blatant request for physical contact that i hate repeating even in my own thoughts she seemed so dedicated to me and knew that i was dedicated to her especially after i went to bat for her by standing up to one of my best friends i did not know what to make of it i wanted to break up with her but for political reasons i was vice president of an organization hoping to be voted president eventually i did not but it was an extremely huge blow on my self esteem no less than a month after that a girl who i had been friends with before she left school passed away a few of my friends were extremely grief stricken i was busy organizing my school is homecoming to keep my mind off of it no less than a week later yet another devastating blow was dealt as vice president i worked so hard to change some of the things within our organization that were holding us back like trying to have sex with your friend is girlfriend come election time i was excited to maybe have my big break however i lost my job the one that i had clearly put so much effort into obtaining to someone who hardly put in any work to deserve it frustrated i walked away from the entire election having no desire for any other position another month had passed and it was now january i had begun to distance myself from everyone and was drinking heavily i was angry to the point of acting violently towards anyone who looked at me funny my best friend my girlfriend and eventually the bulk of all of my friends had turned their back on me within a two month period my girlfriend was still around but i constantly told her that i felt like nobody was there for me including her it drove her crazy but she still stuck around out of pity most likely fast forward to march february got slightly better but i still had the angry outbursts a girl who i did a fair amount of work with at my college and who i had begun to get close to while obtaining our goals committed suicide using a shotgun i had close intimate contact with her previously and it freaked me out quite a bit knowing that something like that had occurred between me and someone who is now no longer with us then after reading her obituary which read like a job application she had quite a lot of reputable academic and social achievements i realized that the most frequently referenced accomplishment listed had to do with the work that she and i did together with the school we won a first place prize for it i could not help thinking that if she blew her head off like that she may have been miserable that whole time we were working together but along with that despair she probably thought of the happy things in her life before she put that bullet through her head if that was mentioned most often in her obituary then it must have been frequently referred to and fondly mentioned in her everyday life was i one of the last things she thought of as she toyed with that trigger that freaked me out even further and it was almost unbearable bringing back the other bad things that had happened over the past year finally as if things could not get any worse i received a phone call on a weekend trip that was supposed to be exciting and freeing it was from one of my fraternity brothers back at school one of our other brothers had been found dead on his couch that morning he was close to us all despite having only transferred in the previous august after serving two years in the navy he was older than all of us and very much a role model it was very hard to finish up the school year after that so within an entire month period i experienced a betrayal by a close friend infidelity by a girlfriend three deaths two of which were quite close and the loss of a job that i had been busting my ass to get i get angry quite often and every little thing bothers me nowadays coming back home over the summer was relieving until i realized how demanding my father who is a retired army colonel can be oftentimes i hear get over it it is life it happens but i just ca not come to terms with that my anger depression sadness and other negative emotions have snowballed from being very infrequent to being prevalent for most of the waking hours of the day i just want to sleep so i do not have to get up and face reality i am paranoid that something else is going to happen and i am delusional thinking that some supernatural forces are at work here trying to make me miserable i know that things like this happen in lots of people is lives but i ca not help but think that everything has been turned completely upside down for me i am young and these things have been very condensed without much time to recover between two catastrophes should i just get over it if so how do i even start should i transfer schools and leave the bad memories behind forever but abandon my few close friends and girlfriend for a fresh start with new people that would set me back another two years as far as my education is concerned but i do not doubt that it would be beneficial in some way i apologize for the long post and thank you all in advance for your consideration,depression

-30.581017,16.675434,uncontrollable anger i have dealt with depression a couple of times in my life it often lasts around a year but will typically go away which i am incredibly grateful for however this time it is really different i find it is manifesting into this weird uncontrollable rage i have never ever been an angry person and when i am angry i wo not lash out or yell i will just keep it inside until i inevitably calm down however during this bout of depression i am finding that i am just so angry about everything it is almost like all the emotions i have been holding in just burst out of me and i am unaware of what is going on until the anger subsides for example the other day i was doing my makeup and i kept getting mascara under my eye and it happened maybe five times before i lost it and started throwing shit and scream crying i even threw my chair at my door i have never experienced anything remotely close to this type of reaction before do not really know what the point of this post is maybe i just wanna know if other people have the same thing guess i do not wanna feel completely insane hahahah,depression

-1.5421854,37.732937,dumping a girlfriend i both love and hate hey gang first of all my heart goes out to each and every one of you i have been a longtime lurker but i suppose it is time to change that it is funny to note how we all joined this special little club in the first place the reasons may be numerous and they may be unique to your life or mine but the struggle the struggle is something that gives us all a sense of common ground in noting our differences i wish all the best to you tomorrow morning will be days clean from heroin just saying the word aloud makes me feel gross in fact i rarely spoke the word i despised it so much that did not stop me from re upping time and time again for just about months after i quit drinking hell it was not like i had that beautiful stash of oxy and fentanyl anymore i digress i should also note i did a large portion of my detox in jail i probably would not have slept those six nights at home anyway but shoot it surely sucks when you are up constantly for hours in a place like that however as grueling as it was it was a beautiful place to grow up in a sense so now i am in drug court i ca not afford to relapse in more ways than one i must say the full cycle of withdrawal was longer than i thought it is different for everyone naturally and luckily my appetite was starved being in jail once i got out i gained about lbs food was just about the only solace i had when i returned home that and chewing tobacco and coffee i know that chew and coffee ultimately make withdrawal worse but my mind needed something since my folks have me on house arrest that is all i got the chills man those are always the worst for me maybe i am just a wimp but i feel those chills something fierce and for a long ass time they finally subsided today sure i might have a little chill at a warm point of a movie but i can live with that they almost feel good again like when we were kids paws beyond that bitch insomnia i must say i do not really have any post acute symptoms my nerves are still a bit tender but no more cravings my mind is still a little fuzzy but that is just the lack of sleep it will come i really need to exercise more i feel well now though almost sober sleep may not come tonight nor the next night but i am optimistic in building a life in which i own i deeply regret all those wasted days in withdrawal on the couch that being said i am glad this last time hurt for so long if it did not hurt i would not have a reason to stay sober sober life to come i am a little afraid of what to expect mostly i am scared of how lame i will be without using which is ridiculous because all i cared about was h in the end i did not do anything and cared about nothing so i am going to embrace that wild and crazy part of myself that lead me into this mess in the first place i am going to stop apologizing for the things that do not need it i am going to throw away my bullshit sense of entitlement i am going to learn how to make all that pain in the world my strength i am going to relearn how to be a beacon of light in this mixed up world i regret the time i wasted and the years it took me to get this far i am also so grateful for both those things we all have a long road ahead and we are never finished growing failure is not the end but rather the catalyst into success you can do anything you want to you alone sit behind the wheel and only you can drive to the promised land i am not done yet but if i can come this far after years of opioids alcohol i know you can too whether you want his help or not god bless you remember happiness is not given to any of us you are going to feel like shit for a long time but the choice to be fulfilled and happy is up to you make it whenever you are ready no rush take care you have earned it peace,drug_addiction

-3.1807134,6.775459,the legal system vs disease opiate addiction hello r opiates long time no see a little something crossed my mind this afternoon i just wanted to get some feedback from our wonderful community as an opiate addict at some point you could quite possibly eventually have a run in with the law even at no fault of your own it happens everyday and subsequently as is notorious in the united states you will likely end up being required by the courts to take the old piss test myself included i know most opiate addicts are really good people but we are just totally slaves to our addiction for no reason other than we have fucked our brain chemistry up we do not want to be sick fight or flight it is not a character flaw we are not fucking losers we literally have a fucking disease so where i am going with this if one of us in the medical world is legitimately diagnosed by a doctor as having the disease of opiate dependency should not failing a drug test for opiates fall under the same category as being an issue that manifest itself from the disease i understand opiates are unfortunately illegal the way some of us take them even if we hate it and want to be opiate free we are chained by the illness my question is if someone was in recovery and genuinely trying to fight their disease would not failing a drug test for opiates just be a symptom that results from the disease i know the courts are about years away from even considering seeing it this way but honestly could this logic be used as a defense if you were to find yourself fighting a positive drug test i am not sure i have explained myself well enough but you guys are smart can hopefully understand where i am going with this what are your thoughts edit and honestly on this same tip how can jails deny you legally prescribed suboxone if you or a family member brings it in correct container i mean these are supreme court level type questions my local jail would literally laugh in your face as they handed you your size too small sandals flat mattress u kickers x u schvetty balls u papdugi,drug_addiction

7.261115,33.142918,how i stopped binge eating i have not had frequent binges in over months i binge just as much as your average person now say if i am out at a restaurant and there is a lot of food or maybe munchies with some friends on the weekend but nothing more this is not instructional this is just my story how it started i was super depressed in grade because i moved to a new school and the kids were dicks and i would binge to temporarily alleviate the depression as you could imagine it only made it worse i felt like i had no control when it was happening guilty and fat etc it would typically happen when i got back from school or in between lunch breaks when no one was home this lasted a year and at the time felt inescapable how it went away when summer rolled around i was so happy i didnt have to see the kids from highschool anymore and i got a full time job in landscaping which i loved and i could focus on going to jiu jitsu in the evenings more than i could in highschool because i didnt have homework i stopped feeling the need to binge because i was in such a good headspace and also i didnt really get a chance to because the routine i was in did not allow for it because i had to pack lunches and snacks for work so i ended up meal prepping i prepped breakfasts snacks and lunches breakfasts because i wanted to reduce my morning time also i could not bingeat dinner because i typically ate with my family and also i didnt want to feel sick later when i would do evening jiu jitsu and after jiu jitsu i didnt want to eat too much because i didnt want to feel full in the morning and not be able to eat breakfast because then i would get hungry before lunch at work so it fell into place since the change my eating has not been perfect since but i deffinitely no longer have binge eating disorder and when i do notice my eating is irregular it is a lot easier to shift it whereas before it felt emotionally draining to deny myself binges it just feels like habit to stop at a comfortable amount of food relapses have happened but rarely i have had a smattering of emotional binges but nothing significant summary establishing a routine with built in endorphin release which consumes a lot of time is what helped me most for me the most effective way to change my routine was money incentive as well as being in a loving community because i was paid to do landscaping which was physical labour outdoors with co workers i got along with and i paid to go to jiu jitsu with people i who were also my friends that supported me and helped me grow,eating_disorder

3.9647863,-31.918526,is this guilt as some if you may know i get constant intrusive thoughts and when i get them i start to talk to myself in my head saying that i wish i never would ve gotten these thoughts because my life would be better without them it s like i feel guilty i feel very hopeless it s a very horrible feeling is this really a form of guilt and can ocd make you feel guilty for thinking this way,ocd
14.135194,37.201324,doing the right thing so as nobody will rightly know because nobody has been told because i told nobody it is a year since i was discharged from the mental health ward and a lot has happened since then this is not necessarily a post of hope but more of a reflection my ptsd and its side effects have been on the violent side and going through therapy i did not believe that i had enough faith to talk to someone who is basically employed to babysit my brain what was really on my mind the cause of everything after a few sessions of not getting anywhere i accidentally perhaps subconsciously in feeling safe blurted out a small sentence about what happened to me at school for the first time in over a decade and a half i named my abusers to another directly and told the therapist what happened be warned this spun me down a seriously dark channel of anger and want for revenge however i do believe that the therapist did not take my call to murder all paedophiles as a serious threat it was just pain leaving the body in the form of some molten words passing through my soul so i decided to do the right thing i told the police in my eyes you earn your humanity by protecting the weak and needy by strengthening the community around you and by living a good and honest life so i am going to stand in that court room i am going to look those weak cowardly and inhuman pieces of filth in the eyes as they try to defend the indefensible it no longer will be a series of horrific events shared between a victim and abuser a judge will have the final say and i am prepared for whatever he says the be the end of this chapter in my life i hope to move on and begin my own in working falling in love hopefully raising a family and protecting them from the darkness that i was not doing the right thing is not always easy sometimes it will torture your very fibres and interrogate what you believe in stay strong and keep breathing justice is waiting somewhere in the future make sure you keep the faith and when you have the chance do the right thing also therapy works,ptsd

14.422018,28.258661,calling other freeze types how do the traits that pete walker lists work out in your own life what successes if any have you had in dealing with them that you can share with the rest of us i am rereading pete walker is complex ptsd after one year it is been so fascinating to revisit certain parts of it and see that they resonate even more than i thought they did i have come to find that i really truly am a freeze type among the detrimental characteristics of the freeze type a few that walker mentions that particularly resonate with me are dissociative isolation couch potato hermit achievement phobic elsewhere in the book he says that freeze types can be prone to seeking refuge in watching tons of tv escaping in books especially stuff like sci fi and fantasy solitude and giving up on others online browsing he says they often master the art of changing the internal channel whenever inner experience becomes uncomfortable when especially traumatized or triggered they may exhibit a schizoid like detachment from ordinary reality well friends this is certainly me the part that raised the hair on the back of my neck was actually achievement phobic i am simultaneously an ambitious person my husband says i am hungry for success and achievement and he is right and i am also a freeze type which means that i do all of the dissociative activities above for hours and hours days upon weeks i have short spurts of creative or productive inspiration but they fizzle out something in me just breaks and i give up on my ambition or my project and this is what i am most curious about other freezes does this happen to you too the fear of achievement the switch that just turns off even if you are hungry for it i feel like the next stage of my recovery is to explore this phenomenon and understand where it comes from and what it means i am not currently able to afford therapy because i have terrible health insurance so i am reaching out here to see how others have experienced this and other freeze issues thanks edit thank you for the gold today is my cake day too marking one year on this forum one huge leap in recovery and above all the sensation of not being alone in the struggle,ptsd

-1.7572855,35.15738,a cry for help i have had depression since i was in my early teens i was socially inept and so had a lot of trouble making friends the friends i did have beat me up and abandoned me when a girl started to make fun of me choosing to try to win points with her by mocking me further i did not feel like i could do better however and so never made a serious effort to find other people at college i could not tolerate being in such close proximity to so many people all the time i could not study due to a lack of motivation and so ended up wasting my time i struggled after that between joining the military and finding a job in the end i decided the latter and became a software engineer the company i work for gave me an opportunity transfer to india for a year and lead a small team i did just that packing up all my things and leaving after all what did i have to lose when i got there not much seemed to change i was still alone only in a new place with six different languages that were all but martian to me through a friend i had met a woman an architect and although we did not talk much at first the absence of that friend for a few days sparked something between us the problem was that i still did not fully trust her as disgusting as it sounds i just wanted to have sex with her i loved the attention i was getting and really did enjoy being around her but the end goal was the same eventually she found out my game and we split for a period of a few days in which time i found how much i really did care for her time passed and i struggled to get her to give me another chance i knew i had done inexcusable things things that i would not forgive myself but somehow she did she gave me a deal i had to change the narcissistic parts of myself the lines of thought that led me to deceive her and then she would take me back she told me of her own situation something which she had not lied about but had not spoken about either she is married to another man the ceremony having passed only a few months after i arrived in the country he was her best friend but she did not love him only a short while after finishing her master is degree in england did her parents begin again hounding her to get married they set up men for her crazy religious hindus as her family is associated with so her friend offered her a way out he had feelings for her and so on a chance she took his hand in marriage she never felt anything more for him telling me that they had only kissed once since they had been married before she knew that she could not love him she loved me and when she said that and every time since my heart has swooned i have struggled to become a better person for her to support her in any way that i can but things are going sour i was working illegally in the country placed on a business visa allowing me only to go to meetings in reality i was working some days most days even later i had to come back to the us while an employment visa gets processed my arrival was only weeks before today the distance has taken a toll on her and i as we try to find time to talk to each other with a hour difference i stay up late most nights usually into the early morning in order to have a short conversation with her on weekends we can video chat and when we do all those negative feelings wash away when i can see her smile i ca not help but do the same but recently i have seen something odd i message her over facebook and although she is online she takes hours at a time to respond when i ask why she gets defensive she tells me she loves me to my face but i feel like she is losing whatever feelings she had for me she puts in no effort to talk to me when it is not convenient for her and tells me i am not doing enough when she told me she wanted to end it i nearly through myself over a cliff not quite literally yet i felt angry sad confused i could not imagine a life without her i still ca not i ca not fathom her in love with another man one that i know has been abusive to her when i think of her following tradition and having kids with a man who neglects and abuses her a man who used to be her friend with me being across the world i do not see any hope for myself yes i realize that there are lots of women in the world and thus there is a high probability for me to find somebody else that i would love equally but i do not want that i have the woman i love but she is slipping away my future is bleak now i have days to get a rifle in that buffer time i want to try to enjoy my time on this planet to treat my parents and siblings well to love and care for everybody i come in contact with i want to see if i can find another purpose for living before it was only cash and girls but after experiencing the warm love of a woman i ca not be that shallow after feeling that high i ca not live any lower at the end of those ten days i will pick up the rifle and commit suicide by cop i hope to see my last sunset on the hills beside my home i hope everybody can understand,suicidality
