-0.56339025,0.06707572,sue the drug company i read an article yesterday about some state suing the pharmaceutical company for the burden put on taxpayer for the massive opioid addiction my first thought wa what about the people who are addicted the drug company had to know opioids were highly addictive when they created the drug yet doctor were handing them out like candy it s my opinion that the company and the government knew the toll it would take on society but chose profit over human life i am not an addict but i am the widow of someone who wa he wa in his thirty when he became addicted to opioids from a back injury he wa a sweet gentle man who worked hard to take care of his family and i loved him dearly however my love wa not enough to save him he died alone in a hotel while away on a job cause of death huffing computer duster the opioids had him and would not turn loose i m guessing he did not want the shame of asking for pain killer so he turned to huffing the point of my post is when are the drug company going to be held accountable for this epidemic and chaos they have caused because you see i am their victim too his death crippled me i am the devastation left behind from the greed of these company,addiction

0.5163717,0.6682772,i almost killed myself last week a redditor saved my life thank you please read my story it could help you or someone you know i almost killed myself last week and thankfully i did not an extremely nice redditor u loud smile helped me more than he will ever know i have still got problem and i am still going to be homeless very soon but i finally feel that everything is going well and i am going to be ok i am not nearly a pessimistic a i wa this time last week i get paid soon at my new job and i will be ok soon if i am homeless it should only be for a week or two top i can probably handle that it is not something i want to do or anything but i am not going to kill myself i had so much dread and anxiety and have had such a hard time lately that i wa committed to ending it i would researched for a few day i had a plan i had necessary supply i wa ready to go i wrote all my note to people and then the night i wa going to do it a redditor a stranger paid for my room and took away all of my anxiety and fear and gave me hope and peace for the first time in a long while he did this for me a stranger who ha had a bunch of problem both self caused and fate causing lot of bad luck lot of bad decision lot of poor choice i have always considered myself a good person but i have definitely made some absolutely terrible decision that have hurt me and others mostly those closest to me who i have cared for and loved i am clean how and have been for a little over month it is been hard but feel rewarding it is kind of like starting over from scratch you have to learn how to be an actual person in the world again it is like you have been in a coma and you finally wake up but have to learn to walk and talk again you have to remember that there are thing to do that you used to like going to the park hiking biking etc and you do not need to be high to enjoy them in fact these are the thing that used to give you the natural high that you used to have before you needed ever bigger one that lasted all day and you never wanted anything when they came on because you were in a perfect state of bliss the world is not meant to be lived in in a perfect state of bliss that is not how the world is designed it is ok to be sad and tired and not want to go out some night or to just sit and relax you do not need to be medicated for every daily interaction and moment life is life and you can do this but you have to relearn and remember what life wa like before you started numbing yourself to it you used to have dream and goal and choice and friend and idea and a future before you threw away everything for that ever next high you traded long term stability happiness and peace for a series of short term solution that left you with nothing except an unquenchable desire with unachievable need and unattainable urge you bought and then continued to buy a daily struggle with every fiber of your being it destroyed your life and the very idea of who you were and who you thought you were both were destroyed along with your name reputation and place in the mind of others now you will be forever marked with the stigma of your worst mistake and lifelong struggle you will forever have your trust and intention second guessed and double checked it is going to be a lifelong daily struggle to come back into the world and stay a part of it you will need to always remember that one slip up turn into the rest of your presumably shorter life so if you really want to be a better person and really want to become the man you have always wanted and known you can be then you need to stay the course while your mind heals and rewires itself right now it is set up for huge boost of instant gratification that happened a often a you could make them all you wanted wa intense euphoria that lasted a long a possible you did not want to do anything watch a movie leave the house talk to someone drive home do the dish live etc you did not want to do anything even the tiniest of thing without that euphoria you have to know that it is going to take a while for your brain and body to change from that being it is normal state it is going from take a while you can do it but you need patience and time treat yourself ok do not panic do not let your emotion control you you have two option do what you know is right or let the disease of addiction finally destroy you and everything you have ever loved hoped to be dreamed about envied marveled coveted and wished to do the idea of you can either be whatever you can set your mind to or it can stay the sad reality that is the life of an addict nothing in your life that is not about your next high there are no friend no love no dream no truth no future no past no tomorrow a today is the only thing you can think about the next second the next minute the next hour the next score the next fix the next high the next low the next scam the next lie the next buy the only thing that matter are getting and using getting and using getting and using getting and using all of the people and relationship and thing in your life only serve a a distraction and are either tool to be used or useless object in your way in your forever immediate need to be getting and using to those who you ca not control or use or get something out of they are not at all welcome in your new world where those are the only criterion you have for what and who you want in your life whether they can offer you something anyone who ca not personally help you is not needed and are only distraction to your new and true need and desire getting and using anyway i am still staying strong and i know how deep and pervasive this problem is and i truly want to conquer it so i am hoping that i finally can wish me luck thanks all i have been on autopilot for too long i am ready to take back control and fly straight and true not just keep trying to go higher and higher life is more than getting and using it is more than what it is been for the last few year it is more than numbness and forced euphoria it is more than the same desperate routine that you become locked into the routine that destroys all self respect and pride that destroys all admiration and friendship all hope and joy all future and past all now and then you become a singular creature that is no good for anything in this world except it own selfish desire and they will never be satiated nothing will be able to fill the hole and the void that is inside of you because with every single attempt you do nothing but widen the void every time you try to fill it you feel it close le and le while getting bigger and bigger that void will eventually devour your soul and very being and you will never know truth or happiness again be warned anyone who want to dabble with certain drug if you could not tell addiction is a son of a bitch do not ever start and if you do get help immediately everyone start off thinking they can control it but at that point you have already lost control thank you for reading and please if you or someone you know need help reach out to someone a friend a neighbor family a stranger me your mailman anyone do not do anything permanent that you will have no way of knowing how bad you would immediately regret the suicide prevention number is call them they are wonderful now for the desperation part but if anyone ha they would be willing to put towards a week in my room i can send you the hotel info for renewal you would literally be my hero lol sorry for the desperation anything would be a blessing a of today i ate the last of my pasta and i could send you a picture of my fridge there ketchup packet and an of a jar of jelly with even le in my cabinet this is pathetic for me but i am still really struggling and i wo not be able to get paid until this friday i thought it wa last friday but apparently my job pay every two week and not weekly a i wa told when hired but that is ok i will be ok i desperately need help but i will not give up if i ca not get the help i need i know that i wo not quit trying anymore it is hard to not want to give up and get high when everything is so terrible but that would not help anything and

0.42547214,1.634709,the idea of never getting high again why it is so hard to accept why you need to accept it and how to accept it i could never accept the idea of never smoking again my problem is that i have an obsession with experiencing thing while high for example i need to know what this song is like while high i need to know what it is like chilling with this person while high i need to know what this place is like while high etc etc even though a lot of the time i get super anxious and paranoid and thing are worse when i am high while i am high i tell myself i do not ever wanna do this again but the next day i am back in the old mindset why do not we learn from our mistake i have gone from multiple time a day to only smoking about time over the past month but i am still an addict you would think it would be easier to control myself by now but every time i smoke the craving come back full force and willpower is not a long term solution i could never keep a streak going even after day of not smoking you would think i would be free but the obsession with needing to experience thing while high wa still there and eventually i gave in but last week i realized something after again experiencing something while high and having a bad time no matter how bad the experience is your brain wo not learn it is addicted your brain is wired to be extremely motivated to seek that thing it see a a reward even if once you get it it is the opposite of rewarding that is the disorder in other word an addict reward system is fucked up and the thing you are addicted to get prioritized over other thing even if the thing you are addicted to is not rewarding at all and unless you allow the reward circuit to rewire and re prioritize everything it will stay fucked up this is why trying to cut back from being a full on addict to just smoking once in a while never work you are not letting your reward circuit fix itself and re prioritize even if you do not smoke for a month thanks to willpower you are subconsciously still seeing weed a this massive reward and you are brain wont rewire the only way it will rewire is if you accept the idea of never smoking again and go about trying to do a many different thing while sober that you can thing like meditating and working out are definitely great thing to do but make sure to let yourself do some easier more naturally rewarding thing a well to start the rewiring of your reward circuit binge watch netflix play video game go to a nice restaurant who care just make sure to let your brain rewire to experience reward without the need of weed the idea of never smoking again is scary a fuck but it is a lot le scary if you understand what is really going on and that your brain is lying to you right now because it ha not rewired yet and smoking wo not actually be that great you have to trust that after lot of sober living and rewiring of your reward circuit getting high will be nowhere near the top of your priority anymore good luck,addiction

5.4765444,3.5877614,this is how people with adhd can work twice a long work x faster complete more than x the amount of task see over more detail and still feel like crap for not getting anything done here s an example i use to explain to others what happens when i m tasked with something over the year task ha meant homework housework work assignment group task personal hobby fill in the blank situation say you ask someone neurotypical to do task a you need it done in hour they look at it and see about step needed complete it they work for hour and get of those done good enough they think in their mind they re ending with a mental todo list finished they go relax for an hour if they got a grade a they walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well so out of task in hour that s roughly one task every min to get done and an hour to relax internal score a now situation you ask me adhd e to do task a i look and see possible detail i catch a vision of what task a could be and am extremely excited by it i see how task a fit into other task b c d e f and how it make them easier for other people task a if done right can support itself help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resource to create new task w x y dare i say even z man if i can get this done task a will be incredible this feeling it s electric at first glance i can see at least detail related to and needing accounted for each of the original step i m unfamiliar with a couple of the detail so i ll need to do some research to resolve my question what s more there are irrelevant detail buried in the pile but i don t know which one yet so i ll need to be actively sifting those out while i work for the next hour i work on it like crazy riding the wave of my excitement guided by the image in my head i m working hard to get it done but because of distractibility i get sidetracked other random task add to that i ve come up with more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant detail it s okay though i m getting momentum and really starting to weave the thread together my focus is having hole poked in it because people keep interrupting me it s not malicious they are just being friendly by saying hi or trying to get me to smile because i look so intense they don t know how hard i m holding my focus together and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of card there s been some unravelling but i try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly i ve been working at a pace of about one task every min i look up and realize it been hour crap i m an hour over i take stock of where i m at i have crossed task off my mental todo list of now but am only about finished that s a big mental f in more way than one so of task in hour one task every minute and only done score f this is how people with adhd can work twice a long work x faster complete more than x the amount of task see over more detail and still feel like crap for not getting anything done okay i try to take stock of where i am at the pace i wa going it will take me hour to finish the break ha made me realize i haven t eaten i m starting to feel bad i m mentally exhausted and my brain is fried i m way over my deadline and it wa needed an hour ago at this stage it not even finished enough to be usable this isn t the first time this ha happened far from it so now i m also feeling defeated i also feel demotivated because i don t actually know how much longer it going to take me to finish so i engage in procrastination a a stress relief tool now i m working much slower because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression this always happens i look at what i still need to do it s likely going to take me a possible hour to work through the remaining task i feel need to get done the end of the task stretch away toward the horizon like a long vast road man this suck every minute i continue is a slog that drag me down further but it ha to get done i stay up all night working on it the silence and lack of interruption help but it s still slow in the morning come the text message people asking me question about the task some innocuous hey just checking on the status of task a some not hey we need task a to be done a soon a possible we have people waiting on it when will you be done i feel shame an immediate dread that feel like dagger stress cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire and then an immediate dive into a full depression i feel they are justified in their frustration i m frustrated with me too why doe this always happen why can t i just get thing done why is this so hard for me when it s so easy for other people why can t i just think more simply and then to add to the heartbreak man this could be so useful and so great if i could just get it done i suck i hate this feeling i wish i wasn t such a failure it s a strange thing we have it s the source of my creativity and wonder and also the source of my darkest time that feeling fade and some thing get better but this pattern seems to be close at all time i feel like i m always trying to defend why creative people seem to struggle getting thing done while it s exacerbated by adhd it is also a problem with creative type while they are commonly judged a flaky or undisciplined i really think it ha to do with the challenge of having more dot to connect than the average person and then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injury that come from weathering other s lack of understanding which then only reflex back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating it own tail,adhd

0.5379203,0.055080168,a poor morning and a confirmation a bit of a creative nonfiction essay i have been doing well for awhile now have not been drinking for day and before the full sober start i would minimized and moderated down successfully but i would arrived at a point at which i realized that alcohol is not adding any value to my life and in reality it wa starting to take thing away so i stopped altogether and felt great it wa not a struggle and the time i had an urge i just re directed my mind and body yesterday a long time friend reached out to me i do not see him often anymore but we go way back to undergrad and have been friend for many year our social circle of course wa steeped in various form of substance use and let is be honest abuse the behavior appeared normalized but looking back now most of the social circle at the college i went to probably were not into the same type of thing we were i do not regret those time a i learned a lot about myself and how human interact socially but i do not live in those time anymore in any event when he reached out to me i thought to myself let is have this be a test so he came over after work and we drank he like to drink and if i am being fair i certainly have spent my own share of time enjoying drinking he doe not make my choice i do so we drank it wa not the most we have ever had together i remember the whole night i interspersed some water we had food our conversation wa cogent but we drank my wife came home not long after he arrived and she hung out with u for a bit i would been feeding my month old son and a little while after she got home we put him to bed i would briefly gone outside with my buddy before that and we shared a cigarette i do not smoke i do not like cigarette i only smoke them when i am drinking with this particular buddy i would washed my hand and face before helping with bedtime but of course my wife still smelled it and i am sure my son likely noticed it too i wanted to get back downstairs to keep talking with my friend and a little bit of a flicker went through my mind what is more important here bullshitting with my buddy some more over another beer or being with my son and wife at bedtime we read him a story somewhat quickly maybe too quickly and then my wife finished putting him to bed i went back downstairs and continued on with my buddy my wife came down shortly after and we ate some delivery dinner my wife eventually went to bed my buddy and i went outside to the front porch and continued drinking we had a good conversation largely based on the grad school program i am currently in and some of it subject matter eventually it got fairly late for a weeknight and my friend left i brought in the unfinished but opened beer and dumped them out i cleaned up a bit in the kitchen and then went to bed all seemed well this morning i woke up with the worst hangover i have had in month i am still hurting pretty bad a i type this i have had some breakfast and have kept that down had water and gatorade and some ibuprofen and i have been working but boy do i feel unwell and i woke up later than normal about a half hour my wife wa not pleased with me the morning routine ran late because i overslept she missed her normal bus i dropped the kiddo off at daycare a bit later than normal my wife and i recently started doing some relationship counseling not because of me or drinking but because we have agreed there are some mutual thing we need to work out and improve a she left for the next bus this morning she made it clear she wa none too happy with how the morning had gone shortly thereafter she texted me that she feel like the day after my buddy come over are always a mess that if i am hungover it throw off the morning routine and she end up running late she is not wrong i rarely see my buddy anymore this is not a common occurrence and typically when i do i see him i go over to his place but still she is not wrong my first reaction wa to want to go tit for tat with her to say isorry but here is some thing that you do that make me resentful and blah blah blah and by the way you did not have to change our son is diaper and get him dressed you could have said you needed to catch the next bus and i could have continued getting him ready like i normally do sure i wa hungover but i wa not incapacitated but i did not say that i just apologized on the way to work i steamed a bit to myself about some of her fault and how she ha a talent for making a lot of thing more difficult than they need to be but i did not lash out hopefully thing will be smoother and we can talk about it a bit tonight and move on i can say one thing for certain though friend i am done with alcohol i care about my buddy he is had his own struggle a messy divorce right after the birth of his own kid perhaps somewhat due to his own unwillingness to address his poorer habit like immoderate drinking and cigarette but if not drinking mean i do not really see him anymore then unfortunately so be it the self test wa finished and the result are in booze ha zero value for me anymore drowned nostalgia is worthless i will not drink with you

3.4784749,2.3692572,thing i wish i knew before i started hey guy currently my counter sits on like week but over the past month i ve probably been sober for of them prior to that i drank in the pro league for about the last decade and now have decided that if i don t quit drinking then drinking will quit me if you re just starting then i hope this give you some idea on what you might expect some of these point are just tip to help you hack your way through your first few day i started my journey about month ago and so far here s what i ve learned i might not be the poster boy for recovery but i like to think it get better at it every day relapse is common i ve had since i started my journey ranging from to week where i ve gone back to old habit it s not a failure so long a you realise why it happened and learn from it for next time my first wasn t because i had a bad day but because i wa having a great one and wanted to reward myself now i take my wife out to dinner it cost the same and i don t throw it up later each attempt get easier on my first attempt i felt angry that i couldn t drink the same kind of anger you get when the power go out and you have nothing to do you just walk around lost i lasted about a week before i caved but imagine if the power went off for a month at some point you you ll just learn to read by candlelight coming off my most recent relapse thinking about drinking hasn t even really been a thing it s like week and i haven t even approached a bottle shop there s always an excuse to drink when i got started and on some of my earlier relapse i wa reluctant to stop drinking again because of some event coming up or because tomorrow s friday or because i still have half a bottle of bourbon and i ll just finish that you can stop today right now even if you re still drunk if you wait for the circumstance to be optimal whatever that mean you could be waiting a long time to take the next step keep something interesting to drink around the house i like sweet iced tea and ribena but i ve heard people swear by la croix and sparkling fruit juice you do you depending on what and how much alcohol you currently drink per night you ll probably need to start hydrating a lot also it feel right having something on hand to sip meal time and early night help at the start ymmv but i found that eating a satiating dinner at like pm or a soon a i got home and putting myself into bed an hour or so later helped create a behavioural intervention that got in the way of my drinking now when drinking is on my mind i treat myself to an early night sleep might suck for about a week i got the sweat and general insomnia some people have much harder symptom than me like i mentioned above get to bed early and you might avoid some of the discomfort of the withdrawal you ll get used to other people being drunk around you this wa a confronting idea for me that other people would be having fun without me but in honesty i far prefer the option of leaving the party whenever i like because i can drive and offering a lift home to people car karaoke with drunk people is like car karaoke with sober people except no one hold back your recycling bin have room for all the shit you have been wanting to throw away in like for ever that tv box from last year the amazon box that could have fit a flat pack living room in it when all you ordered wa battery now that my recycling bin is empty i have no more b trash around my house any more i have some extra cash i actually contribute about double to my saving now so i might actually be saving enough to one day get a house don t give up trying in the past year i tried a few time and failed and said to myself welp i guess i m just not cut out for sobriety that got me nowhere and it wasn t a productive attitude quitting is hard but rewarding not quitting will be harder in the long term if you re just starting today or maybe just thinking about it then i hope this list help prepare you and somewhat motivate you in hour endeavour iwndwyt,alcoholism

4.0373673,1.9049336,time for a proper introduction and a bit okay a lot of backstory maybe this is an overshare maybe i don t need to think about the past so much but i feel like i need to write out and reflect on my journey with alcohol a a way to let go of the thing i ve done in the past i won t go into detail about all of them but i thought maybe i should share it here i hope it s not too long i ve been using this sub a a resource for the last two month i ve been on my sober journey and i can t thank you all enough to have the human connection with ton of folk who know what it s like i am so grateful you are all incredible people i ve been lurking and posting without having told my story and feel like now is the time this story mention some non detailed possible trigger for some such a self harm relapse drug use and sexual assault just to give a forewarning i can remember alcohol being present my entire life there s a photo of me asleep holding an unopened can of beer a a baby it wa funnier then i remember being given a jello shot on a family vacation stealing sip of my dad s beer around the house when no one wa looking i had permission to drink a small glass of champagne at my oldest brother s wedding when i wa my brother and cousin snuck me into a bar when i wa but no one said anything because i looked mature for my age there wa schnapps at friend party in high school whose parent were cooler than mine bottle of bacardi and smirnoff after prom it wasn t much then but it wa already escalating i had my first blackout experience after my high school graduation at it wa one of the worst and one that i don t even like facing in my inner dialogue when i wa i got drunk with my family at a new year celebration and it felt like a movie to me like one of those scene where everyone is feeling bliss and making fantastic memory and that nothing bad could ever happen when i finally went to college i partied a lot because you know college it wa heavy binge drinking and blackout every weekend for a year and a half friend ordered me drink in bar i felt dangerous and exciting for breaking the law fast forward to january i got an underage drinking citation at for having a party in our dorm room caught by the ra s had to pay fine take responsible drinking course which is a hilarious concept to me now and do community service no police involved but it wa a wake up call for me i quit the next day cried to my parent about being a disappointment and lived a strict sober see straight edge and vegan lifestyle for the next two and a half year celebrated my th st and nd birthday sober drinking free soda at a casino having vegan potluck having fun with friend life wa good i thought all the reason for quitting drinking then were similar to the way annie explains why quitting is so hard in this naked mind i continued on longing for a drink wanting to fit in and be part of a bigger circle that seemed to have it figured out i felt left out after the i m better than you because i don t drink sentiment wore off i have lot of opinion on straight edge culture and how it is problematic if anyone ever want to listen to me rant about that i suffered a lot in those almost three year because my sobriety wasn t done with forgiveness and compassion it wa complete and utter restriction and self righteousness i am grateful for remembering all those sober experience during that time i just wish i wa a self aware then a i am now x b now a i reflect on this i realise that i wa already living the life of someone with an alcohol problem addiction run in my family i ve seen it destroy my brother is world countless time before he found sobriety my alcoholic grandfather abused my mother and her family a they grew up my dad ha a couple of beer every day i chose sobriety then because i thought i ll end up just like them the scare tactic worked for a while but i wa in an unsatisfying relationship engaged and terrified will this be my life forever no i can learn to handle my alcohol i clearly hadn t learned up to this point i wa at this time and i wasn t ready to resign my life away to boring sobriety a boring life forever not to mention there were other issue at hand in my relationship that led me to this conclusion but i abruptly ended my engagement and flipped my life completely on it head i started doing drug primarily weed but pretty much anything i could get my hand on and binge drinking define a relapse with a new group of friend i met through my new job i wa having the time of my life everything that wa wrong in the last few year seemed to melt away i lost a lot of old friend because of my behaviour i don t even speak to my ex fianc anymore i wa cold and heartless and selfish but i didn t care i made the choice i wanted to and i numbed myself for the next five year heavily x b there d be intermittent wave of it all catching up to me i d cut back give my body a couple of week break here and there but a soon a i felt better i d go right back to the bottle and the bowl i ve been in therapy most of my life since about mostly to deal with early childhood sexual assault trauma and growing up a a highly sensitive person with generalised anxiety and depression i wa in therapy at that time in my mid twenty and i wonder now what my therapist thought of my substance abuse i had never really talked about my addiction with my therapist before we framed it in the context of quitting smoking because i smoked at the time restriction and negative language make your brain usually want to fight against it saying no to cigarette is le effective than saying instead of smoking i ll have a lollipop it make so much sense now my therapy wasn t a successful then because i didn t let it be i didn t want to quit all the habit that were making my life hell i wa anxious about whether or not i had a problem but i didn t want to look at the solution going back to my unsatisfying life of sobriety that i had chosen to leave behind i learned a lot about myself about how to deal with anxiety and how to be mindful but i wonder if he wa disappointed how i d come in high already or how i drank a bottle of wine to myself the night before i think about emailing him now to tell him how many tool he s given me to succeed how grateful i am how good i m doing but i m not sure it make me nervous to think about writing that email i want to apologise to everyone i affected during this time but i m not sure how to bring it up or if it even matter x b there is so much of that time period i don t remember i can t remember how i felt in general because i wa in a haze almost of the time but i remember the deep depression and anxiety i remember a coworker saying to me you re not an alcoholic if you haven t started day drinking weed before work isn t a drink so i can t be an addict i let that be an excuse for why i continued binging in the evening and all day on the weekend i wa drinking half a bottle of whiskey in one go until it became drinking almost the whole bottle on a regular basis i wa getting high at literally every chance i could on the way to work on the way home from work and in between drink but the thing i do remember the trauma caused by alcohol didn t click the shame and guilt just weren t getting through my head that this wa a problem ex boyfriend screamed at me in public for my drinking problem i woke up late for work and disappointed my boss and coworkers almost daily i picked fight with my friend and partner i wa so jealous and argumentative i drove many time when i shouldn t have even wrecked my car no other car involved thank fuck i wa roofied at a bar because i wasn t paying attention to my drink i wa assaulted put in sketchy sexual situation there were blackout puking pissing the bed passing out in public place and i self harmed with more frequency than ever before but i still didn t quit drinking or using drug x b i wa completely at a loss had finally gotten out of an abusive relationship and started saving money to plan a big move just for some sort of change to escape the life i had created for myself then i met my now husband we fell in love immediately of course over drink but it wa always love i moved halfway across the world to be with him and we began our life together two year ago the drinking didn t stop just because we were happy or in a new place we drank more and more and held on to the bliss until it turned into deeper depression stupid drunken argument and feeling like complete and utter dog shit day after day i had mostly quit drug at this point save a few party and raf where people offered me some but they weren t easily accessible to me anymore i wa however drinking beer on any given day then could house a bottle of wine or two no problem and once all that ran dry we d hit the liquor bottle that somehow survived in our household for more than a few day at a time i wa shocked if there wa a day of the week when i hadn t drank it wa always just about where our next drink wa going to come from can t wait to get home so i can have a drink i m bored want to go to the pub i gained so much weight i blew up like a balloon i knew everyone knew it wa because i wa drinking so much i wa ashamed of my body the walking proof that alcohol wa taking over my life i threw up at my own wedding reception because i drank too much i blacked out at one of my husband work event fought with him the whole way home then put my head through a wall forced him to pry a knife out of my hand because i wa about to self harm right there in the kitchen and then promptly passed out in the bathtub that somehow still wasn t the last straw x b our last night drinking wa at a club where a friend band wa playing this past june it wa a typical evening nothing special nothing hardcore we just got drunk i got jealous and argumentative again said some nasty thing and after the apology we looked at each other just knowing it had to stop the next morning we talked about our plan to quit drinking and we haven t looked back since sobriety is the best decision we have ever made a a couple and for ourselves individually it wasn t easy at first and some day still aren t easy i still get fomo when i hear story about my friend having a blast tripping and getting fucked up at music festival or thinking about how i won t ever get to drink sake in japan but then i reach for my resource and dive in and come back sure a before knowing that it s just not worth it and that it s one day at a time x b since quitting alcohol we vacationed to a new city and spent the entire trip clear headed and present i celebrated my th birthday without a drink socialised sober after some time regaining strength and courage sober sex sober love sober dinner sober morning weekend all of it we are both musician and we played our first gig ever sober last month and it wa such a gift to completely feel the music instead of the drink i think about the intense joy i feel sober and that drive me forward sure it mean that i feel the bad emotion just a intensely but i ve always been a person with big feeling and i welcome them with acceptance and know that they will always pas if anything in life ha taught me that it s that nothing is ever permanent except death so until i m dead i ll work to make my life the absolute best it can be being alive is actually joyful again i m so grateful for a partner in this experience we are each others support system and motivational team we love each other just a much sober we look forward to starting a family someday and we are celebrating his sister is wedding with support from our family this month a well a little note wa even added in the wedding invitation come to this pub after the ceremony for drink or enjoy a nonalcoholic cocktail just for u feeling love to this extreme is such a blessing and i m beyond grateful for every person who ha said a positive thing to me in this journey thank you to them and thank you for this sub the book podcasts all the material i ve kept in my tool belt for support x b i feel like these kind of story are reserved for when you ve reached a long period of sobriety but i m just so fed up with that life that i don t ever want to go back i worry i crave but i m painfully aware of all the feeling that would come with a relapse of course i m terrified it could still happen after a long period of progress but i can t let that get in the way of sobriety being my number priority right now alcohol doe not even appeal to me anymore i m not ungrateful for my experience with alcohol because they have taught me exactly what i need to face my problem now i forgive myself for my mistake because it wa the alcohol instructing my decision instead of my smart capable and compassionate sober mind a my mom say nothing good ever come from drinking and i can say that all the serious mistake i ever made were linked with alcohol consumption i feel stronger than ever and more sure of my decision to live an alcohol free life and really believe that i won t ever go back x b if you made here thank you for reading and remember that your journey is yours alone and you re incredible for being on it peace and love,alcoholism

4.3151836,1.9375104,am and i thought of you yes you all of you in this reddit thread i spent the afternoon of thanksgiving sitting at the dog park reading through all of your post i figured i d be okay that night instinctively i knew i d probably have a glass of wine after all i wa going to my boyfriend is family s house and they were all big drinker and hey it wa thanksgiving and so i had a glass of red then two then four then vodka and soda and then another and another i wa fine before i got in the car to leave my boyfriend saw the worst of it on our car ride home me slurring my speech and not making sense passing out the minute i got in the door him throwing the mashed potato and dark turkey in the fridge for our dog we were gonna give them when we got back a really small thing but one i wa super looking forward to and then it wa am and my head pounded and my stomach wa in shamble and it wa the old familiar feeling and i thought about all of you that who managed to stay sober and how you probably had beautiful thanksgiving and woke up friday feeling refreshed and ready for the day honestly i wa envious of all of you i wa angry at everyone who didn t feel the way i did i woke up and vomited until pm thank god his family didn t see me at my worst and there it is the old thank god from the simple thank god i didn t call him and thank god i blacked out once i wa home to the more frightening thank god i didn t get pulled over or hit someone i m tired of counting my blessing in the most disturbing of way i drank my first beer when i wa behind my house in the bush with my friend who lived nearby my friend and i partied any place we could find empty cabin in open field in our basement in the school bathroom we chugged vodka before class began and the boy oh the boy i drank shot back to back until i could barely see until it didn t matter which one of their hand wa on me it wa all the same but i kept straight a s and got into a private college and nothing truly terrible happened to me just a whole lot of night i regret driving drunk on dark back road because i wa too afraid to call my parent but these were my choice after all and it s what everyone else wa doing in college the alcohol fueled atmosphere continued and suddenly alcohol wa more of a competitive game who could drink the most we had case race where we each pulled out name of liquor we had to drink whoever drank it all first won i remember i pulled out jack daniel i hated whiskey but i drank the entire thing until i vomited but i managed to graduate and i got a good job pretty shortly after and nothing truly terrible happened to me just year having passed by while barely remembering it getting absolutely wasted with an older bartender and getting knocked up just in time to have an abortion before my th birthday adderall abuse mixed with liquor mixed with night with guy i can t remember but these were my choice after all and it s what everyone else wa doing when i wa something switched drinking to oblivion shifted from something i did with friend on the weekend to alone in the evening and another little devil entered my world red wine i mean after all i wa successful pretty smart woman who wa pretty much running her own business and i deserved a drink at the end of the night just like all of my friend and like many of you a classy bottle once a week turned into then and so on and now i m year old and i drink alone until i pas out about every day i order food sometimes twice in a night and then most of the time i binge and vomit and i count my blessing that i m fine and these are my choice after all except that they weren t and they aren t when i look back at every single moment of my life that i regret alcohol is there every decision wa fueled by this little monster i m scared to see what i would write year from now if i keep going this way but that s where the good news come in i don t have to and for the first time ever i have hope i found this thread which ha helped me realize i m not alone and i ve finally admitted to myself that i need to stop i m seriously considering smart recovery which i ve never done before yesterday i opened up to my boyfriend more about my drinking he still ha a hard time understanding how deep it run but he s incredibly supportive and also this year like many of you i found annie grace s this naked mind which made me understand a lot of the why i drink alcohol is woven into our culture so deep that it s overpowering we are david and alcohol is most certainly goliath it s massive and monstrous persuasive and terrifying and we are much smaller but i do believe we have it in u to be much stronger i ve been lurking on here for a while now posting here and there committing to a few day of sobriety but never really fully taking the plunge i love the take it day by day attitude and that s where i plan to start maybe i will have setback but i d rather continue to try to slay this dragon and failing then taking off all my armor and saying fuck it fuck this wa long i didn t expect to write this much and i don t really expect anyone to read this much but i guess it just felt good to get it all out

1.0535908,1.5029708,ptsd gad spouse looking for tip i have been together with my partner for more than year now the first half of our relationship he did not have anxiety yet and the second half is when he developed ptsd and gad sometimes he is like a completely different person from the one i used to know he get panic attack that vary in intensity where he shuts down wo not talk ca not accomplish normal task becomes irritated etc lot of time i do not know what triggered the panic attack and sometimes i am not sure one is happening a a partner i essentially just have to give it time and let it pas only checking in with him sometimes otherwise me giving him attention really bother him one of the big problem here is that talking about his anxiety is a trigger and will time lead to a panic attack also any sort of constructive criticism i try to bring forward even if he asks for help with an email or something small will usually trigger a panic attack we both share a favorite band and going to their concert gave him a panic attack something that made me incredibly sad because we have had so many lovely memory at past concert with the same band i even sat u in the very back on a bench away from lot of people earlier in our relationship we would go adventure and walk around go out just to be with each other now due to anxiety he never suggests going out i have to initiate every single time we go to the grocery store or even on a walk my goal for our relationship wa always to be partner so this is outside the norm for me and feel like a step in the wrong direction i know he love me so deeply but he is not a great communicator and seeing me upset always lead to a panic attack which ha led to many breakdown for both of u x b a little history he had a really terrible few month last year where he wa having panic attack all day every day i did my best to check in with him and be patient but it wa just honestly the worst month of both of our life we had already committed to some travel for a wedding and that trip wa essentially one long panic attack where i drove him around for hour after that i convinced him he had to go on medication and that wa a great relief for both of u now he take x mg escitalopram lexapro per day and very rarely will take hydroxizine pamoate a needed more recently though i feel like i have to walk on eggshell again because the panic attack are coming back le severe but quite frequent x b he ha an individual therapist group talk therapy and psychiatrist but it doe not seem like he ha much self awareness of how the anxiety is affecting him or maybe just doe not know how to communicate it in the right way he just doe not usually seem to come home with any relief or progress x b if i talk to him about how i am affected by the anxiety that will lead to a panic attack because he doe not want to hurt me and feel criticized and like i do not understand the pain he is going through i tried to go to a therapist to talk it out with someone and she told me we should instead do couple therapy together we then did couple therapy but it often felt like we were not getting anywhere because usually my partner would have a panic attack and not be able to speak openly or sometimes agree to empty promise that he did not follow through with x b this is tough because i feel like you ca not force someone to address the issue unless it wa their idea all along they have to be motivated from within and now is an especially stressful time in his life open communication is pretty much my number one value in a relationship so it is pretty hard when i am shut down for trying to communicate i am a shy person by nature so i feel uncomfortable being put in the instigator pusher role for bringing up relationship issue which then is reinforced negatively with another panic attack we are sort of in an unhealthy pattern right now i love him very deeply and hope that it come across in my writing i understand that much of this is outside of his control and do my best to be compassionate loving silly and patient a a partner but wanted to know if anyone ha tip to better communicate with each other and avoid panic attack thanks so much,anxiety

0.7194304,1.9438654,i would like to vouch for a book that changed my life tremendously hey i read a book that really helped me work through some anxiety issue here is a link to where you can buy it i am plugging it because it seriously changed me and i would like others to have that opportunity too one thing that blew my mind wa how well social anxiety is understood by the mental health community i felt hopeless and alone at time a i am sure you do but this book gave me the understanding that what i wa going through wa a treatable and understood issue and dare i say a somewhat common issue social anxiety is often due to poor thought pattern which should be changed or eliminated therefore if you have not already seek help by reading a book on the subject or visiting a professional now i would like to share some point that helped me from the book overcoming social anxiety stop guessing what other people think about you you suck at it i always had a running dialog in my head he think this about me she think that about me now i realize i have no goddamn clue what others think about me so there is no point guessing the book referred to this a mind reading if you are unsure what to do in a situation look for social cue if you miss a cue just move on and realize everyone make mistake think of how a confident person reacts when they make a minor social mistake for example imagine if obama accidentally went to the wrong side of a buffet line would he sulk and beat himself up over it or would he just move on with his day realizing that it is a fair mistake that anyone could have made realize that there is not one correct way to behave in social situation so many question related to social situation ca not be answered with this is right or this is wrong there is tremendous grey area your way of doing thing in social situation is just a good a anyone else is and is not necessarily wrong or right e g there is not a correct way to start a conversation ask a man woman out end a conversation behave in a conversation etc overcoming social anxiety there is actually a decent answer to what do other people think about you that answer is they do not think about you at all or very very little because they are mostly focused on their own concern people seem confident and in control but everyone ha insecurity and most people feel at least slightly nervous in social situation you probably ca not tell this about others especially because you spend most of your time in social situation thinking about your own anxiety recognize avoidance behavior you avoid walking past your bos door you do not go outside when your neighbor are outside these are avoidance behavior and are unhealthy you need to ask yourself why i do such thing ask what is my fear worst case scenario realize your fear is unjustified and then go through and do the opposite and note the result the book ha worksheet do them anyway i could blab all day because it is an issue i am passionate about it is awesome how much my life changed by just getting some professional advice on shyness and social anxiety it even helped overcome other issue now i am comfortable driving a car without fear before i wa too scared that i would make a mistake i wish you all good luck,anxiety

1.6993742,1.2212255,a long detailed account of my personal experience with depression anxiety depersonalization derealization and add and how they are all connected x post from r dpdr i sometimes have trouble describing all of this so i typed this up to read to my therapist i thought that it could generate some conversation or help u identify with each other i tend to attribute my shortcoming to me instead of my illness i seem to have two side one side seems to be unaffected by the mental issue it say you are smart important and loved you have so much ahead of you that will be exciting and worth it all this side is aware of the fact that i am a good person with a nice personality and enough intelligence this is my logical side it is aware that my worry are all absolutely irrational it also understands that it is the irrationality that make them feel so insurmountable the other side is just completely fucked up i ve been given name for all of the thing that are wrong with my brain and it chemical they all seem interconnected a cycle of disorder that perpetuate each other it is the depression that contradicts itself by making me switch between state of empathy and apathy self doubt and self confidence laziness and determination and optimism and pessimism it let me know i m fucked up without allowing me the motivation to fix it it tell me screw improving yourself and making your loved one and yourself proud you dreamt all night and did not rest well at all you need to go back to sleep it make me miss alarm clock no matter what time of day or how many hour of sleep i ve had it make me think about how beautiful and easy it would be to just not exist though thankfully not in a suicidal way it is the anxiety that make me ob over everything both relevant and irrelevant to my life in the present when people die do they cease to exist or are million of people suffering in the hell that i wa raised to believe in if i need someone to run an errand for me will they will die in a terrible car accident it make me have absurd thought of horrible thing like when i wa typing up flashcard and listening to music and thought if i don t finish this card by the next song someone may die despite the acknowledged ridiculousness i felt a wave of anxiety and typed faster it make me have bad dream all night long that make me wake up exhausted like i have been running around all night instead of sleeping it perpetuates debilitating migraine it make me worry about the terrible thing that other people including stranger go through whether fictional or real i sob for these people and feel their pain so intensely that it override my own issue and pain i carry everyone s problem on my shoulder right above my own when i m done worrying about theirs for a moment i have time to fret about mine it s a cycle that only give me reprieve in spurt it is the derealization that make me feel disconnected from my surroundings with varying intensity literally every second of every day since i can remember i m unaware of a reality that doesn t feel like somewhere that i am always right out of reach of or am seemingly experiencing secondhand it make me wake up from a night full of terrible dream into a reality that is dreamlike itself it is the depersonalization that make me have episode where i look at my boyfriend the person that i am closest to and think who is this person i logically know this is my boyfriend of four and a half year whom i love completely but he is momentarily made a stranger it ha made me stare into the mirror and see a stranger paradoxically i have an ability to feel intense empathy yet i also deal with bout of depersonalization during which i feel completely disconnected from myself and others these are actually some of the scariest sensation right under panic attack that i ve ever felt during an episode i usually feel completely numb and apathetic with a mild hint of fear the intense anxiety and realization of how fucked up it wa come after it is the add that make it next to impossible to concentrate on anything mentally stimulating it is easy to focus on mindless task but the moment i try to switch to something that would be beneficial every other possible thing no matter how irrelevant fill my mind i lack the ability to be consistently positive with myself on my to do list i had typed don t be shitty it took me a while to check it off not because of completion but because i didn t want others to see it and feel sorry for me i purposefully pointed it out to a friend trying to make it into a joke i joke around a lot some people have bluntly told me that they didn t like me or that i am annoying others find me hilarious and most are somewhere in an indifferent middle most people would never assume that i have all of these issue they usually somewhat ironically describe me a cheery i have to take at least five pill daily it is hard to know that you cannot function normally without them it is harder to realize that you don t even function normally with them i take medicine for depression yet i don t feel a difference anymore i make excuse not to change it because i am scared of the process of finding a new medicine or that i won t find anything that work and will be aware of my helplessness it is hard to know that people have such a stigma about mental illness my own dad told me that instead of taking medication for my depression i should pray and god would take care of it i have often lied that i could not come to class because i had a headache when in reality the issue wa the state of depression that i woke up in that made it next to impossible to get out of bed most of all i am scared that i can t get better that i ll let my family and friend down and end up alone it s awful to be aware that all of this is irrational yet still be trapped by the fear i want to get better and have the motivation to get through this i want it so much yet i m constantly scared that i can t have it,anxiety

1.6543925,2.093317,tip to combat the fear of public speaking copied from tip to combat the fear of public speaking it is more than excessive shyness social phobia is the fear of social situation which often prevents normal life according to one of the psychological school shyness from social phobia differs only in the degree of intensity the range of anxiety can range from light slight shyness to completely impossible to control escape all self control extreme severe case of phobia are we afraid to call fear of social situation in this case a shyness or a social phobia is of little importance the core of the problem is important the second school distinguishes these two concept according to her shyness is a character trait of a given person whereas social phobia is defined a a neurotic disorder explains psychologist and psychotherapist md phd mateusz borowiec from the krakow center for therapeutic arche a a character of character shyness is accepted by u and doe not make life difficult for u quite simply we know about ourselves that we like more intimate bunch loneliness and peace on the other hand in this juxtaposition social phobia will be what often prevents a normal life therefore an important factor in a decision about treatment which can only be talked about in a phobia situation is a subjective feeling of how the problem with social anxiety lower the quality of our life this is the best indicator in assessing whether the problem of social phobia concern u where doe this fear come from this is an important question that should be posed when we begin to face our social inhibition however the final answer is probably only after the therapy it is thanks to her that we will be able to reach the source of the illness there may be many reason for social phobia in some people unresolved internal conflict may find an outlet in the formation of a phobia for others there may not be enough social interaction that would make u socially fit enough to relate to success and feel safe still in others the phobia may be a derivative of for example low self esteem that is to say the tip of the iceberg explains dr m borowiec regardless of the type of therapy which will be selected only after the discovery of the underlying condition it will always be it main element to get accustomed to social situation you can not overcome any phobia without confronting the object or the phenomenon generating anxiety together and gradually most social anxiety and fear of public speaking can be overcome by practicing very basic technique then again therapy with a good specialist experienced in the treatment of phobia is one of the basic medication for social anxiety that can bring long term recovery it is often supported in parallel with anxiolytic and antidepressant however before the psychological and pharmacological effect begin to take effect let u try to help ourselves by following a few important tip and trick do not strain yourself if you have discovered social anxiety at home it is important that everyday routine activity like professional work are not a source of constant stress you should feel safe in the everyday activity a much a possible adjust your repetitive activity to the degree of social discomfort you feel human have this incredible way of overthinking at the most inopportune time i have an issue where silence brings on a mini panic attack the quieter it is the more i think this is why i will always have music playing softly or a fan on low that static noise help settle the stress i am pointlessly creating for myself gradually the difficulty of social situation do not jump into the deep water right away a ha already been said it will not overcome social phobia without getting used to situation that spark fear however this taming should start with the least stressful circumstance for example participation in a family event or going to a restaurant i have a natural fear of people because of the environment i wa raised in so public speech before the large gathering wa not my preferred method of easing into my uncomfortability starting a youtube channel wa one of the best thing i ever did to work on my social anxiety in no way is it cured and it probably never will be but sitting in a room and speaking directly to a camera helped ease into becoming more comfortable while recording reward yourself rewarding yourself strengthens positive association with a given social situation on a subconscious level so always when you manage even the smallest thing associated with overcoming anxiety treat yourself to a prize it doesn t to be extravagant but have some starbucks go to a movie or even shop for something cheap on aliexpress the subconscious will write in you that behaving in this particular way in the social situation is a good thing there used to be this girl in school that would randomly click her pen every time she had a happy thought so throughout the day you would hear this pen out of nowhere eventually she had rewritten herself to associate happiness with that sound sitting in class must have been the happiest place on earth it s the little thing to go the furthest tell others about your problem this may sound scary but one of the biggest issue in society today is lack of communication we tend to sit with our fear and allow them to eat u alive the art of reaching out take practice most of the time we don t reach out because with feel we are a burden to someone s happiness well this is generally not the case which is worse wallowing in fear and stuck in a never ending loop of anxiety or placing ourselves in a mildly uncomfortable position for a few minute by sharing our feeling with someone that care some would like to argue they would rather sit in fear and anxiety this is because they have found comfortability and solitude in the anxious loop because they are so familiar with the feeling in reality it doe more bad than good youtube is a great place to reach out and connect with your audience simply opening with hey everyone i don t know about you but i have severe social anxiety so forgive my stuttering i just wanted to say thank you for being here simply opening with that statement strengthens the connection with your audience and is an amazing ice breaker relax a often a possible try to unload the cumulative tension a often a possible light physical exercise preferably in the open air breathing exercise may be helpful i found that the gym is my safe space and allows me to create necessary stress to truly relax later under stress breathing becomes shallow which cause the brain to believe we are in a dangerous situation breathing a regularly a possible tell your body it can feel free and safe basic meditation also work remember you get good at whatever you practice so retraining yourself interpret information in a healthier way will relieve stress and anxiety in the long run there is social trait that most people feel but never actually put their finger on what it is it s called the invisible audience it natural human behavior to believe that we are the center of the universe that all eye are on u that s simply not the case although you may feel this way it s really just you and the camera try to remember starting a youtube channel or increasing the quality of your episode start with you your audience is perceptive and ha feeling with similarity too did you ever think that maybe a majority of your viewer are just afraid to start their own youtube channel because of the fear of public speaking so if you have even taken the leap to put yourself out there be proud of yourself treat yourself to something nice i know first hand what high anxiety feel like merge that with depression and alcohol you end up with a failed liver and near death thankfully i am still here to write this for you,anxiety

1.5118974,0.98669434,i think i am almost cured of social anxiety my life story and what i have learned in the past two or three week my social anxiety is at it lowest point in year i am at a point where i think it is not a social anxiety disorder per se but maybe just a little shy awkward but i think i am on my way to becoming an exceptional person socially i will tell you my story it is long i am a year old freshman in college and have at least been a little shy socially anxious etc a long a i can remember i wa just shy and more nervous in social situation than the average person from k but nothing that really wa interfering with my daily life i did get really nervous when i had to speak publicly like presentation or whatever but i just dealt with it a a sophomore and junior in high school it started to get worse but around nine month ago senior year of high school it really started going downhill fast i am not sure what caused it it could have been due to smoking weed for the first time and a couple more time after that drinking or just nervous about college coming soon the last three or so month of my senior year were hell it wa supposed to be a fun time because i basically had no responsibility but my sa wa killing me i wa a good student who rarely missed school but i ended up not going to school more often when i did go to school i would never walk in the middle of the school because i always thought everyone wa looking at me i wa extremely nervous in class all the time because i wa terrified the teacher would call on me one time i had to go up to the front of the class to solve a math problem and got really nervous i wa okay for the first minute or so but i made i mistake that the teacher pointed out i will be honest i am a pretty smart guy so it wa kind of awkward when she pointed it out etc because i wa not usually wrong the class started laughing because they could tell i wa getting nervous my hand and whole body started shaking and i felt like i wa going to throw up i started getting dizzy somehow i ended up finishing the problem and sat down at my desk i wa still shaking i barely made it through school that day i drove home and decided to look up information on how to relax and not get nervous i found out meditation wa a common method to solving those type of problem i gave it a try from that night on i meditated every night for about minute i would use guided meditation video i found on youtube to help me relax my sa got a little better but it wa still very bad i survived the end of my senior year i wa terrified of going on stage to receive my diploma but i did made it summer came and i got a job i wa still really nervous socially i would always turn my head when waking by stranger would get dizzy and have headache while shopping and all the usual stuff that come with sa i looked up social anxiety video on youtube and heard what other people had to say about it i watched many video at least and eventually realized how ridiculous and irrational my sa wa that being said i did not improve too much my rational brain and rest of me were not seeeing the same thing all this time i had kept meditating every night for about minute up until around three week ago i got really busy with work and other stuff and thought that meditating wa not really helping me so i wa like ahh whatever thing slowed down about a week later and sitting in bed one night i decided i would meditate just for the hell of it a usual i searched for anther video on youtube to listen to while i meditated i decided on this one while meditating i noticed my mind wa a lot quieter and i wa a lot more relaxed than normal my body especially arm and leg got really tingling after around minute of listening to it i decided i would try to sleep i fell asleep immediately i awoke the next morning feeling like a new person i felt more rested than ever and something else the world looked so much more colorful and vibrant than it had in month just looking around my room made me happy i continued on with my day and a expected it wa a good day i wo not bore you with the detail but i wa just happier i wa smiling the whole day since that day it is been much of the same for the past few week i am a little shy awkward etc but nowhere near a bad a it wa a few month ago it is manageable not totally in control of my life i plan on seeing a therapist for the first time to get cured hopefully but we will see around five month ago on a to scale being crippling sa i would have given myself a presently i would give myself around a that may not sound life changing but trust me it is a couple day ago i wa walking down the street and noticed a middle aged man wa going to pas me unlike before i instinctively looked at him and smiled nodding my head he did the same back it wa just a simple gesture but i could tell it brightened his day too i have been trying to do more of that sorry for the long story but i will give some tip additional info here if anyone want i could give you the link to some of the youtube video that i have watched that only now are truly helping me key thing i have learned in video what other people think about you and how it effect you depends on what you think they are thinking that is confusing and it is not a great way of explaining it so i will give you an example you are sitting on a bus and two guy are laughing you look over at them and their eye meet yours instinctively you think they are laughing at you and you get really embarrassed oh no they think i look funny in this outfit let is step back from this for a moment and think about it the meaning of their laughter and it affect on you is strictly controlled by what you think they are laughing at if you thought one of the guy told a funny joke and the other guy wa laughing at it then you would not feel embarrassed at all and would just move on with your day or you might ask to hear the joke if you are bold see it is only what you think they are laughing at that matter you are embarrassed because of your thought about them thinking about you not the actual laughter it is not his thought that make you feel embarrassed it is your thought about what he is thinking that make you embarrassed you have control over whether you get embarrassed or not a heartbreaking a it may be to you not many people care about you if you are one of those people who get really nervous shopping i recommend you do what i learned focus your attention on one person and make up a possible life they may have a wife two kid three pet a nice house this person is just like everyone else in the store unless they are a close friend they give zero fuck about your life that man is thinking about an argument he had with his wife earlier in the day how he need to feed the dog when he get home satisfy his kid never ending want and need etc you are the last thing on his mind he is just like everyone else in the store nobody give a fuck about you nobody care that your clothes look ridiculous you keep walking back and forth down the same aisle your hand shake when you pay the cashier you trip on your way out of the store think about it do you honestly care about random people that you rarely if ever interact with yeah it might cross your mind and you might laugh a little when you see someone drop something trip and fall but that is it in five minute you have completely moved on with your life you want to go home to relax after a hard day of working or whatever so what you need to realize is very few people care about you think about how much you think about some random woman wearing ridiculous clothing it may cross your mind briefly and then you move on like every single person on this planet you are the most important person in your eye nobody else matter to you smile more all the time it might actually make you happier a soon a you have negative thought try to move on think about positive thing in your life the reason why you have social anxiety is because you have a low self esteem you think you are inept in some way or every way act more confident walk around with a strut and talk with confidence it might be fake or forced but eventually it will catch on imagine you are nelson mandela when you get nervous walking on a bus you know that nelson mandela is a universally respected person and because of that nelson mandela would strut onto the bus with confidence he ha nothing to be ashamed of just like you think about that quality that make mandela able to walk onto a bus without being nervous self shame social anxiety for some reason you are ashamed of something about you because you think you are ugly you think everyone else think you are ugly and judge you you need to realize what you are ashamed of there is a good chance that you do not know what you are ashamed of this will help you realized how ridiculous you are social anxiety is try to face your fear instead of looking away from that cute girl in the elevator just say hi how are you do it for the hell of it eventually it will come more naturally and you might even ask her on a date i meditate twice a day min in the morning and min at night meditation is a must every day for at least minute if you are not meditating you are not trying to recover from social anxiety i started reading how to win friend and influence people it is definitely changed a lot of my view on interacting with people hopefully it will eventually help me become someone who is not just okay socially but a natural sorry it is really long but please give it a chance it could help you start a new life i used to be not go ten or fifteen minute without thinking about my social anxiety now i go hour with it being not on my mind at all you can do the same,anxiety

2.188267,0.9182503,an interesting continuation of a dream and an interesting theory for the meaning so i often have recurring dream and setting for dream which are usually a continuation where i remember everything from the last time i wa there this weekend i went back to a dark city which i believe is something like a floating island or perhaps section of a large colony ship in space one of the thing i do most often toward the end of each dream is go to my psychiatrist is office not my actual pdoc nor any doctor is office i have ever been in it ha a very eery feel to it there is a couch in the waiting room where the light often flicker and both the doctor is office and receptionist of them office are down a narrow hallway but the first thing you pas is a dark stair case that ha a little rag doll wearing a plain black dress upon my first visit to this place i checked in with a receptionist a one normally would and she came in close and told me quietly if you ever see that doll move tell u imediately that first dream ended shortly after that and i did not see the doll move i still have never had a session with the psychiatrist in these dream but there have been a few time where i see the doll move it is arm or turn it is head in each of these instance one of the receptionist ha come running quickly without me having to yell and taken the doll away somewhere then i wake up this time i would been gradually becoming more and more depressed throughout the dream for some reason it wa scientifically necessary for me to become pregnant but i found i wa unable to and had failed my mission side note want kid but not for another year then i realized it wa my birthday and i had no one to celebrate with no friend almost true no significant other not true and he is wonderful no family that cared kinda true but they also live in other state country so i rarely see them still would at least get a phone call then it turned out some anonymous person had attempted to bribe people into coming to a party for me i went and found that no one had come then of course it wa time to see my psychiatrist i sat a cried quietly in the waiting room until i saw something move the doll she stood up that wa the most movement i would ever seen her make she started to walked towards me the reception had not come yet i tried to yell and found i couldnt she wa coming closer and somehow i knew she wanted to kill me at this thought i started trying to convince myself that this could not be real i must have had a psychotic break but how could i be sure if i wa wrong i wa going to be killed by a demonic rag doll she got close enough to crawl up on the couch she wa right there and i wa convinced i wa going to die but then suddenly i had another thought one last thing i could do i grabbed one of the pillow on the couch and whipped the case off of it imediately throwing it over the doll i ran down the hallway and a i wa still unable to speak i swung the pillow case banging the doll inside against the door a hard a i could moment later my psychiatrist came to the door looking startled suddenly my voice returned and i explained what happened he looked at me then inside the pillow case at the still doll then back at me i wa sure he would think i would completely lost it but instead he went across the hall to the secretary is office and started screaming at the girl for letting this happen and asking why the hell they had not been watching the security camera then i woke up my so thought this wa an interesting dream because of all the imagery there is to find meaning in usually i think that kind of stuff is crap but to humor him prove it is just my mind being a fucked up a usual i looked up doll in an online dream dictionary and came up with this to dream that a doll come to life signifies your desire to be someone else and escape from your present problem and responsibility the doll serf a a mean to act out your wish i asked him if this is true then what the hell doe it mean if i think the doll is evil and trying to kill me then just a i asked that i put that together with the psychiatrist is office and thought of exactly what he responded with i think it mean that you want to escape the bipolar you associate yourself a bipolar the doll is the side of your personality that want normality you the doll want to strike down the bipolar you so lady and gentleman that is it i hope you have enjoyed reading the dramatization my fucked up brain came up with just to say i do not want to be bipolar hope it provided some entertainment,bipolar

-3.1784408,-2.197956,how are you supposed to actually live with this how are you supposed to actually live with this i am quiet or at least that is what i think i am i lived with some base awareness that i am not a stable person for year of my life convincing myself i wa making it up or not a bad a i thought and definitely not in need of or worthy of help i fundamentally lived and looked like a stable normal guy even if under the surface i knew i wa struggling x b then one day it just changed x b professional i have spoken to have implied that some factor or set of factor must have led to it but i do not see it one day i just wa not able to handle it any more year of knowing this about myself and being aware of it focussing on progressing despite bad habit tendency i wa aware of only internally and symptom and aspect i thought were just how normal people felt and behaved i had good period and bad period i grew super aware of my pattern and built control to help myself progress x b then one day it all just stopped working x b i remember loosely having a panic attack in a work meeting and then past that it rapidly got worse i say rapidly but it felt slow i recently had the revelation put to me that it wa only december that i really stopped being able to handle it but until that revelation it felt like month and month like this ha been my reality forever i guess i do see that there were sign throughout last year small thing that could have predicted it an increase in my spontaneous speech and a tendency to tell myself to shut up in visceral response an increase in the frequency of my uncontrollable ranting about work and personal relationship and an increased tendency towards prophetic conclusion this is going place this is going to shit a decrease in my desire to live and a growing argument with myself about why it is valuable to continue doing so x b but the actual spiral came out of fucking nowhere one day i wa just fucked up x b my memory is weird a it is year i just sort of lived with the fact that i can barely remember detail from yesterday and that last week is year ago that the person i wa a week ago is alien to me year i dealt with the occasional flash of memory from my childhood and teenage year that while not always negative devastated my basic sense of self and awareness of the passage of time then one day i just became aware of it and it began to piss me off why ca not i remember who i wa or what i wa doing a week ago why is my sense of identity always so clouded why ca not i remember not for lack of trying anything particularly momentous from my childhood or teenage year x b why just fucking why ca not i deal with this any more x b what changed x b i think i have had my first proper manic episode or at least my first truly unstable period my mood ha been completely off the chart both way cycling rapidly completely uncontrollable i went to the doctor begrudgingly when i first really realised or wa told i am slipping i have accepted and taken medication i developed a dependency on alcohol and have tried and failed and tried again and semi succeeded at killing it i have been to see mental health professional and every single appointment ha been devastatingly useless i am not receiving any real help i do not know what i am expecting but whatever it is this is not matching it i do not know what is wrong with me my experience match that of bipolar and bpd but i have minor psychotic symptom a well i have been told i have bpd by someone explicitly not qualified to tell me that and i have had bipolar heavily suggested to me both make sense but neither really explain everything i guess i went year telling myself it wa not real but that if it wa then when i really needed help it would be there and it just ha not been i have been told i have a communication problem that i am bad at talking about this in a real world context that my statement are too broad and vague and do not help i have been told that my desire for diagnosis is bad or that a diagnosis wo not help i come across so polite and balanced and reasonable in a professional context but it is not how i feel i am so twisted and angry inside i ca not even help myself it seems there are so many explanation for why i am not where i thought i would be when i finally snapped and broke down but none of them satisfy me rationally i know what is going on but consciously i just do not doe that make sense i ca not fault the people that have tried to help the people who have listened but even the most dedicated eventually told me they ca not handle it a i just got worse and worse now i am pretty much feeling alone and that i want to be alone i ca not handle the background track in my mind that tell me dying is a fair solution i ca not handle that this track ha gotten louder such that i am constantly arguing with it i ca not handle staring absent mindedly at the wall imagining grandiose conversation with people making conclusion and decision i know i should discard i ca not handle talking to myself or imagined person and substituting these conversation for the real thing satisfying myself with the imagined and not experiencing the real thing and expressing myself properly i ca not handle the constant feeling that someone is fucking there behind me just out of sight and that sometimes i can fucking see them or something nondescript out the corner of my eye i ca not handle that i remember vaguely what it felt like when i wa fundamnetally ok and that i have not had a single full day of that feeling for month i ca not handle that i still feel like i am making this up or dramaticising it i ca not handle that i want to live but have to argue with myself not to make plan to die x b i ca not handle living in this brain x b i ca not handle that i have not been able to communicate this properly to anyone who is been in a position to help that i function so well thanks to year of resilience that when it come to fleeting moment of absolute breakdown people are so shocked by it i think i remember a factor now that led to it someone at work described me a zen and it threw me through such a loop maybe i appear that way outwardly but how can i when i am so clearly fucked up from my own perspective why am i so good at masking my shit x b when did i stop being so good at it x b why am i still good enough at it that no one is taking me seriously x b i have the horrid horrific unholy urge to prove people wrong think i wo not do anything about it think i am ultimately safe and fine think again x b i wo not but this argument with myself is getting harder x b i feel so much more fucked up than i have been able to communicate with word i am so balanced and polite i am so good at dealing with it i am functional i have a great life that i built myself i had no help or advice from authority figure my parent can fuck off and they did i have gone to people for help and they have judged me a fine i am constantly arguing with myself and people in my head convincing myself one person at a time that they do not really hate me that i should be outgoing that people want to associate with me that i am not a monster that my internal is not my external that i am ok and i should just shut up that i am not ok and i should scream for help i have lost all of the calm optimistic philosophy i apprently had just a few month ago i want to live forever and i want to die now i feel no universal obligation to do either and it is a coin toss which person i am tomorrow i have survived for a few week now on the most brutal metal i have ever listened to in my life it is like a drug confirming and quelling my anger i am obsessed and i do not want to do anything else but experience more i lose myself at gig and i love that person i do not want to live through what is to come and i regret living through what is been i feel like i have experienced enough i want to love my life like i used to and look forward to the future x b day by day i express a different side of this coin x b i ca not handle this and i am still not even fully convinced that i am really suffering x b i am so lost x b how are you supposed to actually live with this,bpd

-0.26604438,0.6368139,so you want to feel depressed rant this really rubbed me the wrong way i have seen it before and i feel like people who say thing like this do not fucking get depression and in fact equate it with something else i wa on a book subreddit and there wa a post suggest me a book that will make me feel depressed empty or worthless people suggested great book that will in fact leave you with these feeling many of my favorite book induce a sense of these and other uncomfortable feeling if the book you are reading is good it should make you feel something and these feeling are often involved but i feel like it take a shallow empty and pretentious individual to seek this feeling out specifically i have noticed in life too there are a handful of musician and artist etc people deify regardless of their talent in order to look complex my sister wa obsessed with kurt cobain for year thinking she wa deep for liking music by someone who killed himself i think she only owned one album by them but thought she wa cultivating this air of personal depression and therefore complexity here i am suffering and she think it is some cute trait you can turn on and off she is so proud of of being on med she doe not need while im finally at the point where i have given in and need them if i am to survive i do not know i feel like there is this stereotype of the depressed artist the idea that people with depression are this way because they see or feel more deeply the ugly reality of the world this may be true in many case but i think it is a lazy and erroneous oversimplification in the documentary lynch david lynch discus the importance of being mentally healthy in order to be able to create art here is the man behind eraserhead meditating every day and he is still able to feel the whole range of emotion and situation in humanity i would give anything not to feel this way i embrace beautiful piece of art music and literature that convey these feeling and i attempt to communicate my pain and want to reach others who share it through my art but depression is not what make me or you or anyone else intelligent or thoughtful i am just sick of people being lazy and conflating the two people asking so lightly make me feel this way fuck you be glad you are not stuck here,depression

0.33145967,-0.07069086,i never thought i would be doing this especially after my teenage year but here i am at i think i broke the heart of someone who i wa meant to be with and it hurt beyond hell she came all the way from australia to canada to be with me we will call her oi oi originally played it off a needing to get away for a few week on a vacation to escape her everyday life but decided she wanted to uproot her life and come on a work visa where she could stay and work for up to year in the end she admitted she really only came just because of her attraction to me and i think the problem is that we liked each other so much more intensely than we were willing to admit we downplayed everything and we just tripped over our own foot and made all sort of stupid mistake and she ended up going back home after month we missed each other when she left it wa complicated because i felt like i had to push her away because of the thing she did the unfortunate thing she did during her visit were all a result of level of depression i had not had experience in dealing with before and i just could not handle the onslaught i e drug overdosing leaving my house in the middle of the night to wander the street in a city she did not know which ended up with a hospital visit one time cutting and a suicide attempt unfortunately my only support ha always been my so and because she wa my so at the time i did not have anyone else i felt like i could turn to for support so i turned to my ex who also happened to want to get back with me bad idea which most people would say should be an obvious thing but to me it wa not so obvious because i still loved her and she had not done me wrong she wa willing to be there for me and support me despite the fact i left her i actually left her to be with oi because i felt such an attraction for her but my ex just wanted me back and not to put up with what oi wa doing to me with oi back home and begging me to ask her to come back to canada and commit to her i needed to be positive that she wa who i wanted to be with from that point on because i am getting older and it is possible she wa the one i wa going to spend the rest of my life with get married and have kid it wa a big decision and i owed it to her to be absolutely sure if i wa going to ask her to come back my ex wa bugging me to hang out with her since she knew that oi went back home i live somewhat near the u border and i wanted to go back to the u again to do some shopping despite having gone recently and i could not go to where my ex lived because of the issue with the rest of the family a a result of the breakup so if we were going to hang out we had to go somewhere i figured i would combine a shopping trip with seeing her a i had done that before she is along the way and i can just include her in something i am going to do anyway whenever i go it almost always end up spilling over midnight into the wee hour so i figured a place to crash motel would make sense to include in this trip so there wa no rush on thing in the past i had sat in the car with my ex in a parking lot somewhere and we would talk about thing that were happening between me and oi but it wa the middle of winter and there wa an extreme cold alert so unless we ran the car the whole time we were going to freeze it turned out to be so cold that weekend that the motel owner had to thaw the door lock with a blow torch for a good second before it would open when we were shown to our room i figured i would get to shop but also spend time with her and gauge how thing felt and we could really explore our feeling about what wa going on i understood that we were going to share the same bed that night but in my mind i envisioned it being a hold me one last time kind of night i wanted to see how much i spent thinking about oi while physically being with my ex my ex had originally pushed me to come on a friday night and spend night away till sunday and i said no just because i did not want to commit myself to anything more than just the extended shopping trip really and give her too much hope that thing were going to go back to normal with her i wa already feeling like this would just be an opportunity to let her down gently a possible and let her know i wa not going to get back with her and that oi had stolen my heart when we checked into the motel on saturday my ex had her own agenda i decided to lay down on the bed and flip on the tv and she immediately go into the bathroom and come out of the bathroom half naked and just came onto me there wa no kissing or anything leading up to it she just went straight for my belt i actually laid there in a frozen state with my eye closed wondering what the hell am i doing it wa such a weird and confusing thing to experience next thing you know we are having sex and really that is all it wa i have made love to woman before and this definitely wa not one of those time there wa not a passion behind it and i knew it wa because i wa thinking about my australian girl and how the second this all began i wa in big trouble a couple minute into it my phone ring and not just any ringtone i know who is ringtone that is it is oi like a huge sign she just had to call right then and there my heart sink and the sex just stop my ex asks who it wa i tell her it is oi and you can see the disappointment on her face she try to shrug it off and keep thing going but my phone ring again it is almost like oi can feel what i am doing at that very moment and i feel like i am going to be sick my ex try to encourage me to stay in the mood almost getting a little angry that i am thrown off by oi is call but that is it i am done the sex is over i already know i am screwed all i can do at this point is turn to my ex and say this doe not mean we are back together i ca not be with you when i am thinking about her she curl up into a ball and cry for the next however length of time i feel horrible but it is the truth the sex did not mean anything i wanted to be with oi problem is i already know that i know oi ha a pretty good idea my ex wa behind why i did not answer her call but she ha no idea what exactly wa going on at the time i always wish she had called moment earlier to feel like she felt something wa about to happen before it had actually happened would have scared me before it all started and felt like a warning sign to watch out but this time her call wa too late i had recently turned over a new leaf and decided that truth wa always the best policy probably the worst time to make a decision like that i knew that i wa going to tell oi what happened because i just wanted to be open and honest worst mistake of my life quite possibly so many time i wish i had lied about what happened but also i do not i had hoped that her love for me would allow her to forgive me when i told her that i wa not going to see my ex anymore and thing were over and i wanted her back here in canada it wa the complete opposite oi figured i wa with my ex and that is why i did not answer but she did not know that i had spent the night with her and that stuff happened until i tell her it break her heart absolutely destroys her in her eye i have cheated on her even though we were not technically together that is how it feel to her knowing how bad she get when she get depressed i am surprised she is still alive once again i regret lying because i did not want to hurt her or lose her but i also just wanted to be honest and not build a relationship on lie either she said my honesty wa something she valued the least i could do at this point wa stay true to my value fast forward month later through on and off talking good moment bad moment lot of fighting i start to compare it to the song battlefield by jordin spark we are fighting over love problem is i am fighting for it but she is too busy fighting against me she say people need to be accountable and responsible for their action and that i made the choice to do what i did i have apologized genuinely and profusely but it seems like all i am doing is annoying her lot of conversation but little result i just want to be there for oi because i ca not hide my feeling for her anymore she is gone and i miss her and i feel love for her but she is too afraid of me and what i can do to her emotion it is like she is forgotten what it is like to feel how happy i can make her i have become a monster to her today oi say she think about me care about me so much and is confused if she still love me i believe she doe under all the confusion but at the moment she is built up very high wall all around she say she want to try and move on to other people but i know we would both rather snap our finger and erase all the bad stuff that happened and be back together and happy that is the bottom line that is what i want to see happen but i have been told by another woman that the problem is that woman will over analyze the problem and tend not to see the simple solution that men do learn from your mistake forgive but do not forget she is still so stuck at that moment busy analyzing what happened coming up with her own meaning of it all that she is lost sight of moving forward if she think that seeing someone new is the answer she is wrong better the devil you know than the devil you do not she know how good we can be together and i have learned my lesson from all of this i would not dare hurt her this way again i believe someone new is such a greater risk than me but now i think she might have already been actively seeking new people to befriend since the incident and see where it go with them and is only holding out on telling me to be nice sometimes i feel like she may even be smug about the whole situation knowing i am in so much pain and getting a taste of what she went through i do not think i could ever turn her down if she wanted to be together again now or in the future because i could not turn her down before we just have something and neither of u can explain it problem is while she is getting daily intensive support from friend and family who are around her almost a well a seeing a psychologist i am struggling to get out of bed in the morning i am an absolute wreck on the inside and barely holding it together on the outside most day i snap at people for stuff and when people ask how i am doing i do not even say the usual i am alright cause i am not i just say eh could be better but whatever who care the only reason i even go to work is to make money in case she change her mind about not wanting to see me so i can pay for her ticket to come back or for me to fly there to show her i am serious about being together i got my passport the other week because i am ready to drop everything and fly across the world to show up at her door she say that she will run and stay somewhere else so i ca not find her if she get the feeling i am on my way there i think about her from the second i wake up to the second i drink or drug myself to sleep some night i get so upset i am on the floor cry smacking my head off of it for being so stupid and full of regret just hating and abusing myself i am taking anti depressant even double what my prescription say mg mirtazipine some night even more and i am still struggling to stop myself from random outburst of tear at work or while driving pleading to god or whoever is out there is listening a chance to go back in time feeling so numb and not caring if i happen to veer off the road and plow into whatever is there she used to cuddle with my shirt she took back home with her every night i am sure she is been convinced that is unhealthy and need to stop even if she still want to she used to have a collage of picture of u on the wall and one of u by her bed i used to think that wa the cutest thing ever and it made me smile but played it cool despite how much it meant to me now the thought of it all stuffed away somewhere if not thrown out cause physical pain in my chest every look at the clock is a conversion to australian time and wondering what she is doing at that moment and if she is thinking of me if she miss me if she think about being with me if she ha dream of being together but wo not admit it because she is trying to push me away every second i am not messaging her good or bad i feel so alone trying not to message her take every bit of strength in my body but when i do i say stupid thing and make her upset with me i push her to realize that we belong together and we need to work this out when i do go without messaging her and feel like i have avoided conflict for a week i realize it is only been day she doe not message me which i have read is a very bad sign that she doe not care and is moving on it hurt to think that might be the case and her love wa never deep enough she say i need to snap out of it and do thing to pull myself back up on my own how can i when i am foolish enough to think that one day i will see her at my door and every day that i do not i feel disappointed and alone and like i am being stabbed in the heart she doe not understand that she is shown me a happiness i have never seen she is seen

wrong with my mind i am feeling apathetic enough right now that i nearly erased everything i just wrote i have that type of problem a lot i do not care about anything i ca not take anything seriously nothing matter i am going to keep writing though i need the input of others because i have realized my brain doe not have the ability to self diagnose i feel like most brain do not over the previous year i have come to the conclusion that i have a slight form of autism or an anxiety disorder or schizophrenia or most recently adhd i have thought about the way i interact with people and the world for an absurd amount of time and now it is gotten to the point where it never leaf my head even when the majority of my attention is elsewhere i will be paying the convenience store cashier seemingly quiet and courteous while actually i am frantically trying to determine if my eye contact looked normal to her or if i should hold out my hand to take my change or wait for her to put on the counter i am incredibly afraid of other people thinking i am not normal or perhaps even more so approachable all i want currently is to be able to have social interaction where i do not feel like i messed up somehow the more i think about it though the harder that becomes i have been thinking about my mom a lot since i have been home from school she seems kind of off to me for some reason it really feel awful to say that i love her but i ca not help noticing these thing hearing about the importance of the mother is role in a child is development ha made me question whether or not whatever mental impairment my mom ha wa passed down to me through the style of her nurturing a cliche a it sound i do not think i wa hugged touched enough a a kid baby maybe it is in my genetics too so this is what i meant about rambling this is where my adhd self diagnosis come from even though i switched back and forth between i am definitively schizophrenic and no no no i am surely mildly autistic while i wrote the previous paragraph but anyway on with my heart spilling i have friend sort of i do not really know what a friend is or how to be a friend i guess i feel like everyone who i would consider my friend care about me more than i care about them and i feel incredibly guilty about that i desperately want to be happy when i am around people but it seems like something i ca not do then again i am not happy when i am alone either so maybe i am just incapable of happiness altogether i think i am just going to list other thing that have been on my mind because i am getting bored of this i feel like my guitar playing and song writing ability are extraordinary though i ca not stay concentrated long enough to finish an entire song which ha led to a vast collection of unconnected verse chord progression and melody falling asleep ha been developing into a stranger and stranger experience i will be drifting off when all of a sudden i can see this incredibly detailed image in my mind despite my eye being closed these image are always extremely random e g the view of my dining room table or a strange blue freckled egg type thing i am not quite sure i have seen before dream have been more vivid too i know this is a side effect of anti depressant which i had been taking for the previous or month but i began having these vision and more realistic dream before going on them the anti depressant i wa on an ssri did not have any effect on me the very first pill i took made me hyper and manically happy for a few hour but nothing felt different after that i have a schizophrenic friend and he is told me that anti depressant have not worked at all for him i know it can take some experimenting to find the anti depressant that is right for your body but this is just something that i think about random instance in the past where people have said something to me related to my personality a girl in th grade who innocently asked me once what do you do all the time do you just sit around and think to a stoned kid i wa introduced to at a college party asking what are you retarded when i told him about the weird food concoction i eat when i am high i ob over these thing in addition to proving my own awkwardness and strangeness to me by thrusting me into more social interaction college ha also exposed me to weed i did not smoke much before this year but last fall i wa up to or time a week weed augments my consciousness in a way i feel is both useful and damaging it make me think more clearly and in a more focused way but it also seems to increase the effect of whatever disorder real or imagined i am in possession of i am starting to see that even though i kind of enjoy being able to think faster having more thought in my head probably is not a great thing wow i am sorry for making this so long if you read all of that you are a saint and i am sincerely grateful i guess my main point is from what i have said in addition to anything you can gather from my style of writing what advice can you give me typing all of this out ha made me realize i need to open up more with counselor doctor so at least there is one thing i can take away from this i am not really expecting any diagnosis but if you want to take a poke i would be happy to hear what you think thanks again for reading edit format,depression

2.902286,-0.42573434,i just posted this to r relationshipadvice but i feel like this is more relevant here i just feel lost it is am here and i have just been unable to sleep with a constant flow of thought i just needed a place to write it all down a few year ago i wa dating a girl and i wa genuinely happy it wa my first long lasting relationship and the first time in quite awhile that i had actually felt happy about a month before i began my first year at college my girlfriend informed me that her friend were betting on when our relationship would fail all of them were predicting that it would end within a month of entering college this hurt i thought i had emotionally processed this and that i had gotten through it the first semester went by there were a few argument that we had had but it had not ended our relationship then january rolled around and i began to get depressed a thought had manifested itself in my brain that i wa not a good person on a daily basis i would take extremely long walk constantly trying to decide if i wa a good person or not i would think thing along the line of a good person doe good thing if i have not done good thing then i am a bad person my entire life people had called me nice i soon realized that they were just confusing nice with quiet shy i wa not nice i did not greet people with a smile when i saw them i did not say bless you when someone sneezed i wa not the go to guy when people had problem a far a i could tell i wa a bad person then my thought moved to how i might be hurting the people in my life i started thinking i wa holding my girlfriend back that i wa not the person she needed to help her succeed in life and for month these thought plagued me what hurt more is i did not have anyone to talk this stuff out with i did not know how to tell her that i felt i wa holding her back eventually i decided that i would have to breakup with her in order to allow her to have a good life so about a year and a half ago i broke up with this girl month after the beginning of the relationship but i managed to mess that up too i had never broken up with someone before i did not know how i knew that the brave and correct thing to do would be to breakup with her in person but i could not for the first time in my life i felt like a coward i had never backed down from a challenge but i just could not face the idea of breaking up with someone i liked in person so i called her i broke up with a girl i had dated for month over the phone the coward is way out on top of that i could not figure out how to explain it to her i made up something stupid about how my grade were suffering and that it wa not her fault but that i just needed a break then when i hung up i wept i wept for hour i had never cried so much in my life i went out and walked for hour and then did not say a word to anyone for week i realize now that i wa probably and still likely experiencing some form of depression although i use this term lightly because it wa not diagnosed regardless the breakup only made thing worse for me mentally and emotionally the following summer i chose to work a night shift so i would not have to see friend and other people that would remind me of my relationship for most of the next year thing did not get better the past summer i took summer class up at my college and for the first time in awhile i started feeling better about myself i started getting back into running and i noticed that i felt happier at time then between the summer and fall semester this year i went back home i hung out with my friend a few time and discovered that recently that had become good friend with my ex a day before i went back to college she showed up to one of our get togethers i had not talked to her or even seen her since i broke up with her over the phone seeing her immediately reminded me of what kind of person i am a bad person a coward and i immediately fell back into a sadness it is been a week now but the thought that i am a bad person just are not going away i have considered reaching out to her and telling her the truth about our breakup to see if i can get some closure but it is been over a year i do not want to hurt her again by bringing up bad memory and so here i am sitting in bed at am just thinking about how i much i suck i thought maybe just writing this out would help me mentally so we will see how this work if you have any advice on getting through this i would love to hear it,depression

2.0609572,1.3671414,my freaking life somebody should hear my story i guess well here i am reddit the only source i know of to tell my story and be able to share it with hopefully nicer people than my family i think that it is easier for me to make a list of all of the thing ive been through and give brief description about said incident than actually tell the story chronologically because my memory is hazy with time and date which you will learn why soon to come my parent got divorced when i come home from the mental institution mind you i wa year old there is no reason for a year old to be in the psych ward anyway i remember walking into the kitchen to my mom being on the phone saying cory and i are getting a divorce i don t remember much after that aside from being really upset and cry a lot then sleeping for a few day it seemed like me and sibling brother and sister slept a lot after that especially after the smoothy mom gave u wait there might be something more to those smoothy mom first boyfriend after the divorce wa jeff we lived in a little town called wetaug at that time we picked up my mom biological father from the bus station he had come to live with u from california where my mom grew up i loved my grandpa from day one he would soon become my hero a soon a grandpa my grandpa moved in it seemed a if my mother decided she no longer had to be a mom since he wa there which started the day at a time she would not come home day she came home drunk came home and had a very loud passionate sex with said jeff guy jeff wa a very stern man he wa mean beat u tried to get u to use meth like he wa and beat the absolute hell out of my mother and this is going to sound absolutely horrific but she deserved it around the time jeff came around mom also started using drug which i assume wa because of jeff jeffs favorite thing to do wa to be driving u all somewhere going mph then stop suddenly arguing with my mom and kick u out of the car leaving u on the side of the road until he decided to come back sometimes it wa minute sometimes it wa hour no matter if it wa pouring down rain degree or degree when he would leave for hour he would always come back drunk and drive u very dangerously home i still to this day do not know how we got home alive there were many boyfriend jeff john richard jason steve matthew and probably more than i don t know about all of the boyfriend i say boyfriend but my mom ha actually been married time anyway these boyfriend were all abusive druggies or somehow trash in someway except richard he wa cool so here come to big stuff my mom ha muchkinsbyproxen which is a big fancy word for her thinking there wa stuff wrong with u when there really wa not kinda like the mom off hulu series the act my mom had my taking bipolar medicine when i wa year old i remember at one point being on medication at once now you see why my memory is fuzzy anywho it wa not until recently when i had a psyc stay about week ago i am btw that they pulled every single medical record and found out that ive seen about different psychiatrist in my year of seeing doctor i have been on different medication and had different hospital stay two of which were completely unneeded and many many many er visit that said on the discharge paper nothing is wrong mom seemed to make up symptom munchins naproxen call dcfs i don t think that my mom had munchkins naproxen i think she had what i like to call playing the system for money and though oh if im a single mother i can get money for kid who have issue which she did she claimed disability on both me and my little brother who she wa also doing the same thing to a she wa me my older sister however basically had to become our mom when my mother decided to run off and do her hoodrat thing at ya know year old so i m guessing my mom didn t do anything to her because she knew she could rely on her to pick up the piece while she is gone which made me hate my sister growing up because she mothered me and to this day she still reminds me so much of my mother i wa constantly molested raped by my mom boyfriend john he lived in johnson city i think idk i just remember wanting to die everytime we went there to go see him he would take me into his bedroom while my mom wa out either with my sibling or his kid and do awful thing to me he would make me have sex with him force his cock down my throat have very very very rough anal sex with me that would leave me bleeding and in pain for day he would touch every single inch of my body and told me if i told anyone he would do this to my entire family and then kill them at year old i knew what wa happening but i could not do anything about it not that i wa not able to but more like my mind and body would not let me it wa kind of like i just shut down i told my mom eventually and she told me to keep my mouth shut and she will handle it well i eventually told someone at my school and he got arrested well long story short he went to jail boy wa that the wrong move for me to make my mom beat me for week on end refused to feed me took all my clothing except one pair made me use the bathroom in a bucket all because i took the love of her life away from her i bet you are asking how dcfs ha not taken u away yet well here is where my mom played the system so well remember the munchkins byproxen well she had made it seem like we were so diabled that we were not able to function on our own and didn t understand the world around u so when dcfs would come to visit which somehow she knew because she drugged u up more the day before and when they would come in to talk to u they couldnt see anything wrong mom had it set up and looking like everything wa fine and she would plead with them that the doctor were wrong and she knew something wa going on blah blah blah and they believed her for year i went through these situation and one very similar to them from being beaten to rape when i wa my mom kidnapped u and ran away with u to idaho where her mother lived that is where i suffered the most abuse being locked in the basement not being fed little clothing being beaten raped by different men mom had taken money from and most of all the separation from my biological father and his parent my grandparent who were the only people i trusted and cared about for the longest of time i think we spent about month in idaho i remember a police officer knocking down the basement door and scooping me up all pound of me i wa at the time and bringing me outside where i had not been in month the sun wa very bright and i honestly had no idea where i wa i wa put in the ambulance where i wa immediately given fluid a warm blanket and a very nice man who told me everything wa going to be okay i remember getting to the er and being wheeled into a room where my dad and grandparent stood impatiently waiting for me we cried for hour and hour i spent a week there just trying to get better and saw a counselor for like hour straight telling my life story my dad slept right beside me for that entire week not letting go of my hand eventually we made the hour drive back home where i had an entire community waiting for me with sign baked good and hug but all i could think in the back of my head wa why did it take you this long to realize we were in a bad home and save u why the hell did it take year of abuse to finally get out i hate people who say i knew something wa wrong but didnt know what to do bitch you call that is what you do there are a lot of horrible and tragic thing that went on in my life a well but these are the one that i remember the most right now and i will probably add more to this a time go on long story short there is nothing medically wrong with me mom made it all up however i now do have ptsd severe anxiety and major depression only because of my childhood or a lack thereof i have gotten the help i need i will never get over my past and that is okay but i am healing and i am getting better and thats what it all about that s it i guess peace out,depression

0.42574087,0.197364,i feel like a failure this is going to be long tl dr at bottom and throwaway for my own reason friend know my real username i do not know where else to turn i feel absolutely worthless and i feel like i am living a nightmare me and my wife have always been great i love her she is everything to me and we are still doing great that is not the issue the issue is my work let me explain we have been together for over year and we went from apartment to townhome to finally a house we bought this house two year ago and have loved it since our only problem is we would been using our saving to pay for our rent mortgage only due to the idea that thing were going to get better work wise i have been at my company for almost year now i started overnights in the warehouse month later i moved up to a finance corporate position a a cashier of sort then just month later i wa promoted again to counting then another month the office same department just handling the paperwork fastforward another month or so our company wa bought out different feeling all around we were bought out by the parent company this could be good this could be bad who the fuck know our logic for it being good and this is a huge point in this post wa that we have always been set on this payscale where there were no voluntary promotion or raise you want a promotion usually you would have to work hard and earn it right nope that doe not matter here you need a raise for whatever reason nope that is not how we work we are the company a multi billion dollar company but you want to make more than k year before tax after it is nearly k nope too bad so we were thinking that the buyout would dissolve this payscale a discussion went about it there were promise and everything better healthcare better this better that etc then my department manager left now we were at the mercy of a manager of an entirely different department because they did not want to fill his position just absorb it with no pay raise to those of u who picked up the slack this manager can be nice but about of the time he is flipping out over some bullshit oh well it is manageable no pun intended or so we thought okay back to our office structure for a second from lowest to highest it go cashier counting office specialist supervisor and then stop there then you have the manager instead of the department head whatever we can do this moving forward another year or so to well last year layoff began not for everyone but patch of people delivery driver few staff in our department and others layoff ended now september of last year this is where thing shifted one of our two supervisor left for an accounting position my time to shine this is what i had been busting my as for over the last year i know i can do it i know how to do all the task and duty balance report everything i had literally been bugging my supervisor and manager about learning new thing since i enjoyed it i really loved this job i applied i interviewed i heard i wa the only one to interview i have got this in the bag but wait someone else from another department interviewed for it but she just got another job in our a p department the rule is you have to stay in a new position for month before moving on sweet i have still got this they chose her over me they bent the rule for her i wa left speechless and heartbroken since that day i decided i needed to move on get out of this company she is become tyrannical treating everyone like absolute garbage and throwing people under the bus this in turn make the manager freak out and threaten u we go to hr but of course hr is there for the company not the employee so that brings u to almost currently been applying for job for a year and had three interview after sending in well over application honestly not exaggerating first one january not a good fit fine with me the company wa a bit scarier looking than my current job second one june huge energy company and had a friend that work there still doe tried following up after sending thank you note and never could get a hold of anyone then two week ago august they call me finally to let me

second oldest my life started well went to private school then wa homeschooling from grade high school with super senior year homeschooling is pretty isolated so i didnt get thick skin we had to do chore for no money and did not get an allowance to teach u hard work my great grandparent were very poor immigrant from europe so we understood to be diligent we could however collect pinecone off the lawn at our old house for each anyway i grew up pretty normal struggled with puberty had many crush and never did anything about it i am good looking and tall and i did not know girl like that i literally did not know girl liked being physical until i wa or so i just thought they liked romantic walk and that made me feel bad for the hormone i wa having so i would never return glance and got really proud about not showing i liked them i did accidentally return glance in english class to a girl who liked me and felt embarrassed for doing that i applied to college my senior year then my super senior year could have gone to miami holy cross vassar hillsdale but chose a local school after visiting vassar and not liking it i enrolled in their honor program and their engineering program insane only about people out of were doing that combo i am a literature buff but did engineering because i had friend who made good money with it mistake should have been a teacher because i am enfj went for money my freshman year i got by but wa already drifting bad i had a great roommate fall term but had bad habit would sneak out and buy candy and isolate spring term i moved mile away with an older couple to save on tuition mistake do not go thru college isolated without your roommate bad idea i had to bike and walk back and forth every morning night with a lb backpack and sneak around the house that couple went to bed at every night and had a rescue dog that wa a terribly ugly picanese that term i failed physic but passed everything else then i got in some fight with my dad and had to move out for the summer some nice people hosted me for free in a rural town mile away so i could take vector calculus i got a straight b which i am proud of but wa the least adept in my summer class i also had to bike about mile a day up and down hill on a trashy bike for class got insanely strong thigh very lonely though sophomore year i decide to drop honor program and just do engineering i told myself i could make friend later mistake do not do a degree you cannot do i had physic with calc diffeq and digital logic in term absolute hell i did choose to move back with my buddy but my room wa bed and got super isolated my engineer buddy would try to knock on my door in the morning to go to class and i would just try to fake being asleep spent ton of time isolating and had to come home after about month of watching sport politics and skipping class i went to walgreens one day and bought worth of sour candy and junk food then ate like half and basically took over the loft area of the dorm and started sleeping up there guy came up there to make out with his girlfriend and wa like dude do you like live up here and went back down embarrasing so i started working at chipotle and then went back to school the next term i convinced the honor program staff to let me back in and dropped engineering i started in cognitive science crazy how much i bounced around all in le than year i never built up any kind of rythym i commuted into school from home with two friend mistake do not commute from home it tore me apart i would never have enough time with friend at school and then would feel lazy at home bad combo my final spring term i wa spiralling hard the worst day wa when i wa walking down a hallway in the morning and wa supposed to go to my honor class to the right but slowed down and eventually turned left and went to the school library basement to isolate in their computer room soon i spent about hour a day there over and over only other regular in that room wa a dude who loved streaming mlb game i got to know him and he is married now and graduated from that dungeon so here i wa rushing to the library each day hoping none of my friend would see me and then darting out a fast a i could at night super ashamed then acting like i went to class to my family i did go to the honor class last time and apologized for missing it to the whole class many of them tried messaging me but i did not respond i left school without saying goodbye to anyone i mean anyone no teacher student no one that hurt i loved people in the honor class came back home and watched iron fist season and march madness my family wa away on travel suicidal thought started flying at me i started working again this time for a terrible bos at a nonprofit from hell wa hell i kept regretting the past year i had a crush on someone in the honor club she wa in a million prettiest girl in the whole school and extremely honest i wa in a small group with her and had many chance with her but never asked her out i would just send her glance instead so stupid i thought it wa too early and that i could just get to know her organically with friend instead of asking her out directly mistake girl like you if you are likeable and if you show it she became an obsession but i never did anything about it she is now married to the dude who replaced me and became roommate with my old roommate when i moved off campus i still dream about her and did so again last night she liked me and it could have worked wa also hell did manual labor landscaping at the nonprofit and do a bunch of shady bookkeeping stuff for my bos who wa always cutting corner then in the summer i got caught up in a terrible scam that cost me over i get credit card mail all the time and my phone is ringing like time a day from them still wa a bit better i started making about k at the nonprofit but bos wa still insane his father never told him he loved him he also became a meth addict in his s and wa in recovery but a compete mess yelling at u saying he would cut our hour totally insane he once called a bunch of people at am because he wa worried about something he also dried his underwear on fan in our office he also used nursery pot to take crap at our nursery site where he lived part time and stole thousand of dollar of plant for our company really messed up person life alone everyone know he is crazy but would not say it when i gave him my two week notice he threatened to sue me i left that job in late and am back home reading reddit feeling depressed but slowly hopeful i am no degree k in debt i do have a strong family but that is challenging because they have their life figured out and i am the only grandchild out of relative that dropped out of college instead of being a teacher and married to my crush i am in severe debt have little self esteem and only remaining friend outside my family reddit ha helped i took screenshots of many post about how thing will get better in life if you are patient but going from my honor club to that shitty nonprofit wa like walking down the street with friend on a sunny spring day and then falling into a manhole and being stuck in the sewer for year terrible darkness in i started a new job in a factory and left after day everyone wa depressed i should have least made k or so before leaving mistake now i am looking at usps or a local job for work this week ha been very dark later night i charted my life in term of my happiness and where i want to be at age my chart at age by is want to be at is very unhappy in dark place is unhappy with some good spot is moderately happy is quite happy is lucky you there is still hope i can pay thing off in two year then move out on my own i can have a pretty normal life by and start dating then so i am slowly turning the corner i am already but i also am only i installed a bunch a dating apps and got several message but then deleted them that wo not fix anything i need a good relationship even if it take year to start i also watched a ton of jordan petersen video on the meaning of life he is like iq with fascinating video but he had to go to rehab recently and got suicidal so he doe not have

-0.16176212,-0.25672695,i am redefining rock bottom every day wall of poorly written and rambling text incoming here feature a lot of i and me statement sorry in advance if you wind up reading to this long winded and self absorbed diatribe i do not know why i am typing out my life story like someone care at i have managed to be every steady middle class parent is deep seated fear of how their child should not turn out i have nothing i am good for nothing i am nothing i guess i should start off with my childhood that seems to be the precursory indicator of how you will turn out right i remember my mother telling me when i wa a she wa driving me to school that she only married my father because she did not want to stay in china and she doe not love him she had me because it wa the easiest way to be financially secure since he would not divorce her if she had a kid i got sent back to live with my grandparent for a while since my mother did not like child and she did not know how to raise one she would exclaim proudly that she ca not even change diaper i remember practicing piano for hour and my father screaming at me and beating my knuckle with a metal ruler until i got the tempo right i remember clawing at the closet door until my nail bled and i pissed myself in fear after my father locked me in the coat closet after he got tired from beating me i remember my mother cry and screaming at night through my locked door a my he kicked her while she wa on the ground and how pathetic and powerless i felt my mother is selfish angry and stuck in a state of infancy my father is a cruel small and petty year old schoolyard bully that only feel frustration the one constant they share is how broken and angry they are at me at themselves at the world for not providing them what they thought they deserved when they came to america where dream and money are plentiful i have forgiven my mother she wa spoiled by her parent and she always expected to get taken care of she smother me with attention and gift when she is happy she can be thoughtful and generous she can be cruel she can be vindictive and she can even be evil but she try i ca not comfort her adequately when she tell me to she want to die because of how unhappy she is and how bad her whole body ache i am sorry when i lied to her face and did not tell her my dad wa cheating on her when he told her he wa on those business trip i tried to rationalize my action by telling myself it would have only caused her more pain since she will never be able to support herself if she leaf him i am sorry i lash out at her i am sorry i am a poor placeholder for a sympathetic ear for her to talk to i am grateful that she sacrificed her freedom to give me a roof over my head and food on my plate i am sorry she put all her hope and dream into me and i am sorry i ca not be the daughter she wanted me to be like apology mean anything i have not forgiven my father he is a pathetic arrogant little man that relies on mockery and belittlement when he ca not win an argument he is an overgrown after school special bully that relies on physical violence to establish dominance over people my mother think she is helping him when she provides excuse for why he is like this he had a bad childhood his mother died when he wa young that is why he is like this it only make me hate him more he fails to accept responsibility for any and all of his shortcoming everything bad that ha happened to him is not a result of his own action but for my mother is failing or my failing every mistake he make is incidental every mistake we make is indicative of a massive character flaw i am sorry that he had child since he doe not have the emotional capacity to raise one there are a few memory that never really made sense to me a a kid that just suddenly click now one is of me sitting in a grimly lit waiting room and overhearing my mother ask the receptionist at the counter for an abortion another is my father peeking at me through the crack in the door when i changed or groping me jokingly from when i wa but i suppose it doe not really matter anymore since those incident have passed school wa not kind to me either when i came back to america i could not speak english so i got lumped in with all the esl kid unfortunately esl is not catered towards chinese speaker so i got branded a slow being fat awkward and slow made me an easy target for getting picked on teacher labeled me a a problem child and sent me home with note that would only result in more beating i would then act out for attention which fueled the fire even more i did not really feel like i belonged anywhere not white enough to be white not yellow enough to be yellow i drifted through new social group every year a the token asian friend never making any lasting friend i guess i wa always defective from the beginning my best friend for year wa a stuffed animal named cinnamon i bought her because when you squeezed her tummy she would say i love you i think i chose her because i wanted to hear someone say it to me i grew up believing in god for some reason maybe it wa because it got paddled into me in grade school but i thought that if you were a good person and you did the right thing that you would be rewarded in life good thing would happen to you the pearly gate would open for you and you would be loved and accepted in middle school i met my only true friend anne is the person that made me want to believe in god she is the reason i do not believe in god anymore i hate to sound like a cliche but she wa one of those girl that make you sound like a cliche she wa the first genuinely kind person i had met that made me feel like i wa worth something she had a laugh that would light up a room she wa the only one who would sit with me at lunch even if her other popular friend laughed on me she would let me hide at her house if my father flew into a rage and went looking for me she would stay on the phone with me and try to comfort me if i wa having a panic attack while my drunk and belligerent father tore through the house we drifted a little in high school and i wa okay with it she wa destined for bigger and better thing and i wa just happy she wa a part of my life i placed in honor is and ap course for high school and wa appointed to a program for gifted student i started drawing and i wa actually good enough at it at the time so my mom fought for me to go to a pricy art studio in town to take drawing lesson i met josh we would pas each other note every session with stupid shitty joke only a th grader would find funny until we would get separated to different table i thought that thing were finally looking up for me he wound up raping me october th we went to go see where the wild thing are a movie on the loss of innocence and the end of childhood how fitting i should have fought harder i should have screamed i should have done something i just lay there until it wa over the most i said during it wa for him to please stop just like my father josh hadn t respected my ownership of my body and my right to be free of physical pain i remember him rolling off of me and apologizing i am sorry i am sorry i am sorry like apology mean anything i walked home after i got dressed the walk home alone wa even worse than the actual rape itself in a way the two mile felt like two million mile i puked on the side of the road and almost got hit by a car but to be honest i do not think i would have really minded i had never felt more alone i stopped going to art class after that i did not tell my parent i did not tell anne since i wa too scared that she would be too disgusted to speak to me after my parent found out once they found a pregnancy test in my trash can i snuck out to buy it at the walgreens around the corner the look the clerk gave me said everything disgust pity all because of a little blue and white box i tried telling my mother what had happened she did not believe me and called me a whore i needed her and she could not be there for me but i forgive her since i think she just doe not understand what rape is like or how to handle the aftermath my depression crippled me after that i became agoraphobic and stopped going to school most of the time i gave up on myself i failed of most of my class and i just could not muster the energy to care i do not know if i have forgiven josh i want him to lie awake at night and spend hour replaying those scene wishing through choking pathetic sob that they could change the ending i want him to be so deeply ashamed of himself that he truly belief his family would stop loving him if they really knew the truth i want him to look at other people who are happy who have healthy relationship and feel broken i want him to feel enraged whenever someone spout off just world philosophy bullshit i want him to avoid mirror because he ca not stand to look at himself i want him to spend countless night getting drunk so he will finally have the courage to kill himself only to realize that he is a coward just like he already knew deep down i want him to spend minute of every hour in the handicap bathroom at school trying to calm himself down i want him to think about my face any time he is feeling sexual pleasure or getting naked or masturbating and i want that image to crush any hope of arousal i want him to fear being out in public because it feel like the truth of those experience is written on his face i want people to tell him that his pain is not a big deal and that he should just stop thinking about those night because honestly what is it really helping i want him to feel like i am inside him all the time mocking him for every failure panic attack and sick day i want him to believe that it is always going to be like this i want him to feel like trash actual trash i want him to feel angry and have no outlet for that anger except his own body i want him to feel weak and useless i want him to feel defined by those experience i want him to feel like a monster i want them to feel like me but most of all i just want to be able to move on and forget i could not deal and i failed of most of my class but i just could not muster the energy to care teacher called and emailed and pulled me aside asking why i wa throwing away my life that i wa smart and i should know better that they believed in me my future ap lit teacher told me that i remember you from when i wa subbing for your honor is lit teacher you are very smart and i really hoped you would have academically blossomed by now i pretended i blew off school because i did not give a fuck and not because i wa scared i wa actually stupid and thought that by pretending to not give a fuck people would not realize that i wa actually too stupid to do well even if i tried i got arrested for shoplifting i still have no clue why i did it and the shame and embarrassment of it still keep me up at night sometimes i am sorry to all the teacher i let down that kept giving me chance i am sorry to the counselor i kept lying to when i said everything wa okay like apology mean anything my father is beating became more brutal and more often one day i thought he wa actually going to kill me while my mother wa at work and i called the police on him his mugshot popped up on a bunch of those leech site that publish that sort of thing and i wa glad he got what he deserved the charge were dismissed after he agreed to go to anger management class he still denies ever doing it to my mother and the rest of the family he blame me for it still like i called the police on him and they arrested him for no reason i fell into a shitty abusive relationship with someone who i now suspect is a psychopath i am not throwing that word around a an armchair psychologist or a an insult but i truly believe he fit most of hare is checklist for psychopathy whatever meagre accomplishment i achieved he had already done it faster and better any time i called him out on his lie or contradiction he would automatically try to recover and gaslight me into apologizing i could never question his action and everything he doe shall be accepted without question everything bad that ha happened to him ha been someone else is fault he view compassion a a finite resource that most people do not deserve his rule towards other peple do not apply to him but he wa very charming surrounded by acquaintance but i do not think he actually had any real friend he just threw me away without another word when he got what he wanted out of me my father had raised me to be yelled at terrified and mistreated just like josh and my father he did not respect my ownership of my body and my right to be free of physical pain i had continued my relationship with him because it resembled my family dynamic being with a violent and manipulative man paralyzed my free will and made me forget that i had choice but i had never found it unacceptable because i wa used to it i still kept in touch with anne since she still loved me throughout all of it she wa my sister i went over to her house and i found her in her room i saw her hanging there i cut her down and felt her weight sag in my arm i sat in the waiting room of the hospital for hour praying to whatever god wa out there for her to pull through i begged someone out there that i would be a better person if she would pull through they took her off life support a few day later i should have known that she needed me i should have known that she wa hurting i should have been there for her i should have been able to help her the note just said i am sorry like apology mean anything i did not go to her funeral i could not see her in a box like that since i am a pathetic coward after all she is just gone now into some vast plane of nothingness that if there were a god he would have heard my plea he would not have taken her away from people that needed her she would not be burning in hell because she wa in pain i would rather choose to believe that there is not a god out there instead of one that would allow such horrible thing to happen not going to see her one last time is one of my biggest regret after she passed i would still call her cell phone to hear her voicemail greeting so i could tell her about my day like she wa still there i have never felt more alone than on the day her parent finally cut the line and i just spoke to static i am sorry i could not be there when you needed me anne my depression crippled me after that i became agoraphobic and stopped going to school i gave up on myself i dropped out after my junior year i am just a neet now i have not showered in over a week much le combed my hair or gone outside i have not spoken to any of my friend in month i have a few online friend that i speak to and act normal around for a few hour a day but they do not know how shitty my life is or how pathetic i am i ca not sleep and my focus is shot typing this poorly worded piece took me much more energy and time than i would like to admit all i do is sleep and eat i disgust myself so much i actively avoid looking in mirror i ca not think critically anymore i am smug and pretentious and secretly afraid that i am just stupid and worthless like i know i am and that if i try and fail everyone will realize how stupid i am i have no meaning in life i have no greater purpose i only exist to take up space and energy and resource and to disappoint people i hurt everyone every relationship i have ha failed and i am the only constant i am not talented at anything i am too far behind to catch up i am not passionate about anything i am a fucking coward i am trash i want to care about thing i want to be normal i want to have friend i want to trust people again i want to have energy to do thing again i want to be happy i want to feel like i deserve being happy i want to go work at a non profit before i go back to school i want to go back to school i want to have a

7.140666,1.2030519,useless thought i hate working i am lazy i actively avoid stuff that i used to enjoy i am not going to explain why but to put it simply it s because i am a shitty person i don t really care about not being shitty at this point either which probably make me an even shittier person but whatever my parent decided to give me one more shot at college i told them that i wa dropping out but in the last moment i changed my mind because the thought of leaving a very good school and my childhood dream wa too much for me i shouldn t have done that because at the end of this year when i tell my parent that i failed again they are going to be angrier this is my fourth year and i couldn t even finish the class of the first year my plan for this year is to sleep and play computer game sometimes i will get high on my anxiety med but i can t do that too often because i actually need them i will not go to class even if i want to because success make me narcissistic i don t really care if other people see me a a narcissistic asshole but when someone get even more successful than me it hurt a lot it s not like i wa a really successful person either but once you get caught in it you start to become delusional or something i guess the reason why i am so addicted to it is because i am unhappy with my gender so i feel like a monster in my body and i have a really really shitty personality i also use antidepressant but i can t endure the first few day because of the side effect it take a long time for me to convince myself to start them because they make me puke and i am really really scared of puking i actually just decided not to take the latest antidepressant my psychiatrist gave me because of this i don t know what will happen when this year end i don t want to work i don t really want to do anything in fact i hate seeing myself happy do i would actually stay away from doing thing that would make me happy the thought of my parent feeding me is embarrassing but hopefully i will get used to it and stay with them until they die i don t think they will kick me out so what keep me from not killing myself well there is this small hope that i will turn out fine at the end somehow i know that just hoping and not doing anything is almost always going to fail but i digress another thing that keep me from not killing myself is the fear of death i guess if i could become completely hopeless and i could somehow overcome the fear of death that would be great if that happens one day i will be ready for it i have the required material to kill myself painlessly i am not going tell what i am going to use though i can t hold myself responsible for another human being death i am a trashy person but not that much,depression

-3.4910617,-3.1998208,anxiety severe ocd internet addiction socially awkward no romantic relationship no talent complete loser i hate myself and i hate my life i never would have imagined that i would be actually writing this explaining my problem to the internet on a reddit sub tonight though i wa feeling pretty broken so i just decided to go ahead and type this up i thought maybe getting other people is opinion would help me with my issue because i am starting to feel like i am out of option let me start this off by saying that i am twenty year old male community college student i am currently living at home with my parent i am working and i just recently this semester finished up with my general education credit before i get into my problem i do want to let you guy know that i do have a very loving family and i am extremely thankful everyday for them and for the kindness they show me they are the biggest reason a to why i have not killed myself in addition to this i also have three good friend who do care about me and accept me for who i am and i am also truly thankful for them a well yet though i am thankful for all of these thing i am still unhappy and here is why i wa diagnosed with ocd when i wa eight year old and i actually have a pretty severe case of the mental disorder i wo not get into too much detail here but i will let you know it ha seriously negatively impacted my life many people here probably know a lot about ocd and let me tell you i have literally gone through almost every type of obsession in the book this along with the generalized anxiety i have been impacted with ha made my life very difficult at time for example when i wa eighteen i tried to get a job at a restaurant and during job training i suffered a massive anxiety attack and broke down cry in front of everyone needle to say i wa not hired my anxiety and social awkwardness make it very difficult for me to be around people a you may guess this doe not effect me too much because i am not a social person in general and i am happy with the friend i have but it is still unpleasant it make even day to day interaction with people a challenge and i have a very hard time making new friend the three friend i do have are all a bit different themselves and that is why we connect since starting college i only made one new friend and he just earlier this month ended up not wanting to be friend with me anymore without a word of explanation when it come to girl i am even worse a i am still a virgin and have never even been kissed in all my life i have only had one girlfriend a brief month and half relationship with an acquaintance back in my sophomore year in high school when it come to dealing with people i seem to have an especially hard time with female not only am i shy and nervous but i often get the feeling that most girl my age simply do not like me for some reason i rarely ever have any interaction with them at all though i certainly do not help with this because i never even try to talk to them it funny because i am definitely straight but i honestly cannot ever see myself in a relationship i really ca not and i am not sure i even want one ever i seriously do not feel normal nor do i feel like i can even relate to people at all i do not even like being around people and i am never truly comfortable unless i am alone in my bedroom the main thing i have trouble with though is my lack of talent i am literally not good at anything nothing everyone i know seems to have some level of talent in an area be it science art music sport except for me there is not one thing i can honestly take pride in and say i am skillful in this is the main cause of my depression and this also ha a lot to do with my ocd for the past two year or so i have become interested in digital art and d modeling animation so much so that i have even decided to major in it but i have been having a very hard time teaching myself it complicated but my ocd prevents me from teaching myself because of all these dumb rule it ha me follow which i am powerless to resist and on top of that because i have very poor focusing ability in addition to all of my other ailment this new psychiatrist i am seeing ha told me i may also have add that is part of the reason i have decided to major in the subject because i doubt with my focusing ability that i would ever be able to teach myself this on my own and it is my one true passion in life a major reason for why i am not able to teach myself this stuff or practice it is the internet addiction i have for two year i have become completely addicted to the internet and spend most of my time in my room looking up stuff on my iphone and computer my ocd ha effectively kept me from my art and from reading which wa another hobby of mine that my ocd ha now prevented and so the majority of my life is spent in front of a screen looking at trivial nonsense for the most part my ocd is literally preventing me from doing the thing i want to do and i am powerless to stop it eight hour a day and often more i am on the internet it is a drug to me i seek therapy and take medication have been doing that since elementary school but it doe not seem to help i am hoping when i start taking my art digital medium class next semester i will be able to pull myself out of this two year slump i have found myself in but for now i still feel stuck that is what is going on with my anxiety ocd poor social skill and above all my lack of talent at anything and my ocd preventing me from doing the stuff i want a well a my disgusting internet addiction have landed me with this crippling depression i now have it ha caused me to hate myself and my life and at this point i do not know what to do hopefully you guy can give me some advice because i am feeling pretty defeated now i have become bitter and angry especially when i see all the great work some of these other artist out there are doing and knowing that i ca not be one of them thank you for reading this though in any case and i would appreciate any advice also sorry for such a long post if you read any of it i still thank you,depression

-5.212696,-3.0226998,is seeing a psychologist instead of a psychiatrist a waste of time i asked a family member to make me an medical appointment because i need help i literally fear having to talk to stranger which i am sure sound pathetic they made an appointment with a psychologist when i asked them to make an appointment with a psychiatrist the reason is that i would very much like to try medication to see if it help i am not discounting the potential benefit of therapy in fact i would welcome it nor am i trying to imply that medication is some magic bullet that fix everything i just feel like i am going to go see this psychologist and they are going to tell me what i already know which is that i am depressed if they think i should try medication they are likely going to refer me to a psychiatrist who can prescribe medication my insurance doe not cover either so i feel like it would be a waste of time and money to see a psychologist if the outcome just turn out to be they recommend a psychiatrist i am just looking for anyone who ha some insight on this situation,depression
4.628914,1.698788,i need somebody to see this i need someone to just understand i m sick of feeling alone i don t know where to start so i m just going to write until i ve got nothing left in me i guess i feel tired but i can t sleep i no longer have the energy to do the thing that i like i m failing to see any purpose for myself everything i do end up failing i m no longer happy i haven t been happy for year obviously i ve had day where i feel good but overall i ve just been fairly numb to everything this probably all started with my step dad he wa abusive towards my mother and also myself the argument would happen so frequently that when i d go out with my dad when i wa on my way home i d have anxiety attack this wa at the age of i didn t help that while i wa in school i wa bullied i wa often in a lot of fight that s not what bothered me what bothered me is when my friend would take advantage of me being slower than everyone else and try and play tag with me and make me it so when i d try and try get them they could all run off and leave me they d call me a big fat disgrace little bit harsh for someone of that age to be saying that to someone else i didn t really have many friend when they weren t in i d sit by myself and i wouldn t move i also wouldn t eat some day i did but for the most part i wouldn t eat my dinner i got into a lot of trouble i misbehaved a lot i don t really know why because i really did try and be good i found work hard a lot of the time i struggled and i always felt like i wa failing and that i wasn t good enough because all the other kid could do the work but i couldn t i felt stupid useless when i got home i d just go to my room and play with my toy or draw i wa very creative i loved art and loved using my imagination i didn t really watch the tv that much a a kid i do however remember one time i wa watching the tv and an argument started and i could hear the shouting getting louder and louder so i shut my door and turned the volume up i had my hand on my ear but i could still feel the bang from my mother being thrown about through the wall there wa one time i walked into the kitchen to see my mother cutting herself with a kitchen blade not sure if she wa trying to kill herself or if she wa just self harming i do remember a lot of the time i would see her exfoliating with steam and i would say please don t kill you self because i thought she wa trying to drown herself i know my mother wasn t particularly mentally well so i can t blame her for anytime she snapped at me but it not to say that i still hated it i hated being shouted at especially for thing i didn t do the way my mother would react to a kid of my age misbehaving or simply making a mistake wa wrong she would scream and slam door and then not talk to me but in the morning she would be completely fine it wa confusing for me i wa scared of my mother i wa scared because of how i knew should could react so i always tried to behave a best a possible but i always ended up slipping and the shouting would happen again i hate anger i hate people being angry and i hate confrontation it give me anxiety it s so bad to the point where i can t ask people for thing i hate talking to people a well and not being i m antisocial but because i feel like i m bothering them i had a lot of problem in secondary school a well the bullying continued and even though i wa somewhat popular i would still isolate myself from everyone else i liked to be alone however because i had felt rejected a lot of the time in class i would try and act up try and be funny to gain recognition and acceptance this would lead to me doing very stupid thing such a drinking tabasco and eating raw chilli in class i would always try and be a clown to feel something because a lot of the time i didn t feel anything while i wa in secondary school my mother had a breakdown she would drink from the moment i left to go to school until or at night this affected me badly i hated coming home i hated how she wa always drunk she wa angry and violent for week i would come home to someone i didn t even recognise i became very sducidal at this point i hated everything i felt stuck and trapped this effected how i wa at school i m grade dropped and i didn t put in the effort a much a i usually would i didn t try i wouldn t bother most of the time i d just worry about what i wa coming home to that fear now some may think i am being dramatic but this is how i felt how i felt towards a certain situation is not something that i could help i don t think that it helped that my mother boyfriend at the time came round and the never came back leaving me to deal with this all myself the smashing of photo having to hold my drunk mother back from doing stupid thing to inevitably be pushed over by her and then sworn at i m not entirely sure when my depression really started i think it started at a young age and then progressed a i got old and got worse it probably wouldn t have even happened if i didn t keep having thing happen one after the other so college time is here now and my mother ha another breakdown i could see this progressing slowing a her behaviour changed drastically she would shout and yell at me a lot more that usual for the smallest of thing she made me feel like a bad son a lot of the time made me feel very useless and a small it got to the point where she went away for year and i wa left by myself for the majority of that time i became very independent and i enjoyed that i enjoyed being alone but i became suicidal throughout this period all because of christmas time in i wa hacked and made to look like a terrible person all of my photo were deleted message were sent out to friend and family a me which confused everyone nobody really believed anything i said i wanted to die i had enough i m not a fan of christmas anymore so after that my confidence in every dropped the people i wa around i thought hated me i didn t want to be around anybody because i felt like nobody trusted me or really liked me and if they seemed a though they did it would have been fake so once again stuck in the cycle of just wanting to be left alone,depression

contact at all we talked every single day for month we were best friend a well a lover the week before high school started i again asked her if something wa wrong and i wa petrified scared that she wa suicidal but no she lost feeling for me four week before it felt like we were closer than we have ever been and it dropped dead after asking what is wrong i begged her for a break for her to have time to herself to try to get help because she needed it i then learned she stopped taking her zoloft or prozac i forget and i know what that can do to a person now she self medicated with high thc wax everyday abusing it the last time i talked to her i went to her house to talk to her in person she wa saying she doe not deserve me and i should forget her and that she just doe not feel what she felt before i broke i contained myself until my friend picked me up and that wa the last time i saw her i left hundred of dollar worth of stuff that i either bought for her u but i broke so i did not care then the first few day of school i wa a mess she wa in my homeroom so i switched homeroom i would see her in the hallway we walked together every day the year before it felt like i wa being stomped on over and over again each time i saw her after the first week she started cyber school a i later found out after a friend told me this helped alot but the damage wa done that is the past i want to tell myself i am over her and the relationship and that i miss the happiness that i felt because since then i have not felt happy not one second of genuine happiness i then found out a few month into the school year that i might have adhd so i got tested and sure a hell i matched almost every symptom for both inattentive and now i know hyperactive i have tried so many different medication for my problem lexapro for over a year which made me numb and after felt x worse they put me on prozac and lexapro for around a week which wa the worst week of my life tbh fast forward i wa on adderall but had adverse reaction so they switched to ritalin and eventually added wellbutrin focalin and now hydroxyzine for when i have panic attack or symptom i smoked marijuana maybe biweekly to daily to a few time a week depending on the circumstance i am now in my third week of college i have been seeing therapist for over a year i do not feel better since i have been in college none of my friend from home have reached out or responded to me i have become basically agoraphobic to my dorm room idk if that is the right term and every mi i have get worse and worse i am a very logical person i thought i wa over the relationship i definitely am not i think the main part is i crave the happiness i felt i have not felt anything for a significant amount of time besides pain self hatred and new symptom that seem to develope with my anxiety and depression i have had thought well more like vision of killing myself but i am not suicidal i do not want to die but i do not feel a purpose in myself i hardly recognize myself in the mirror and feel disgust i lost my best friend of year and the friend group around her now it feel i have nobody my family support me but my mother always brings up my ex and say that the way i have been ha had extremely negative affect on the entire family i feel like i destroy everything i get close too i wa a great student now i fall behind and forget everything i had my first full blown panic attack after a ptsd response the other night and felt crippled if it happens again i will not be able to succeed in college i feel like im failing myself and everyone around me and i have nobody i lost everything and everyone no medicine work they just make me feel worse or weird but without anything for adhd i will probably harm myself i have more to say but i find myself disgusting for writing this out tldr i basically have no positivity in my life nothing to look forward too nothing that matter to me and i affect everyone around me to the point where i lose them edit i now realize this is unorganized and i hate myself for it but this is all i can do right now edit i do not know what i hope to achieve in posting this but if anyone ha anything to say that can help please i have nobody,depression

-0.21665262,0.056733355,how leaving everything behind quitting my job and building a startup improved my life plot twist i am in more pain than i have ever been in year but let is rewind quite a bit at the age of i had a breakup with my first love i could not deal with it properly and isolated myself more and more from friend until one day i did not have a single friend and i wa basically just putting up a show to anyone co worker friend that i would never see only on fb i knew eventually i wa so depressed that i had moment of pure emptiness feeling nothing which wa scary in the beginning at some point you accept this pain or emptiness it becomes natural you feel like this is who you are who you are supposed to be that you are not able to change who you are you try to accept yourself this way because you do not feel any strength to change your life you feel like nobody will understand you you feel like you ca not go out in society meet new people and just make friend what will you tell them after all right hi i am andreas i have no friend oh by the way do not expect to hear any exciting story from me doe this sound familiar did you cling to anything to make meaning of life maybe work did you look for something to make all your far too long painful and tiring moment more enjoyable you are not alone sometimes i would go on vacation to other country because i wa longing for place where i would find something to heal me a place where nobody would know me but of course those moment would never last i would have a few week of a good time maybe even met some people from a website and had some short lived nice moment with people but the truth remained i wa incapable of social interaction burned by the feeling of having no identity not knowing how to fit in all my life consisted of pretending to be alive to others this wa my life for the last year until i attended startup weekend manila last october startup weekend is an event held every half year or so in many bigger city around the world during the event you pitch present your idea then people vote for their favorite idea and form team around their favorite idea you are then building a startup business over the weekend working on design working prototype of an app doing market research creating a presentation and eventually you will pitch what you have worked on to respected businessmen on sunday ironically during that event i wanted to pitch my own startup idea friendzone an app to help you find friend in your city because i wanted to find a way to fight my own depression and because i believed there had to be many people like me who were eager to meet someone like me not judging my horrible past turn out i never pitched the idea though and ended up joining another team and winning the competition with them i already had booked a one way ticket to manila before this event but i am sure i would not have really made my dream to move to another city reality if i would not have won this competition winning this competition wa the tipping point for me to abandon everything and a my mother would call it run away from my problem she wa absolutely right yet wrong at the same time there wa nothing i could run away from since i had nothing left in my life even my family relation were terribly broken i just wanted to be alone all these year i felt ashamed of who i wa last february i flew down to manila with my saving and wa eager to continue working with my new found teammate on my startup our team broke apart eventually due to bad communication this wa my first startup experience and it wa my first failure i left the team once i realized the question what the fuck am i doing wa far too apparent in my mind i quit because i knew i had to do something with meaning so after i left the team i continued with my idea friendzone joined the founder institute a startup accelerator and eventually realized i am doing it all wrong wa friendzone really the way how i could fix the problem of depression i felt like i wa going the wrong way so i abandoned friendzone for another project i have been working on while being at the accelerator now i am working on my own startup pigment a marketplace for print shop with the vision to fix the broken printing industry in south east asia i still do not know how to fix the problem of depression i still do not know how to help other people even though i felt the pain for so many year myself in fact i still feel it i started with how leaving everything behind quitting my job and building a startup improved my life having a fresh start for my life definitely helped i made time more friend in the last month than i have made in the last year i have felt alive for the first time in almost a decade so my question can a new country heal a broken soul wa answered with a maybe i have never been more alive before i feel emotion i feel pain i have cried a lot in the last month feeling alive come with one tradeof you feel emotion life is no longer meaningless there are thing that you love and thing you want to fight for thing are at stake your happiness is at stake i still feel disconnected from people i am still afraid of never being seen for who i truly am i am afraid that i will have to pretend for the rest of my life i believe i will always carry this pain of the last year with me this is part of who i am but i do not want to hide it yet i am afraid to show it just writing about it cause tear that have to be supressed while sitting at a coffee shop i know depression is still a big taboo topic in society and i am very proud and grateful for anyone who ha the strength to speak up about it publicly i am grateful for anyone who share their own pain with the world to be vulnerable and have them see it and perhaps this is not a bad thing i am writing this post because i am in pain because i still do not feel connected to the world a much a i would like to because i am flawed and because i do not want to give up i believe in my startup and my will to continue fighting to build a better life for myself that i can make a change when i joined startup weekend last october and worked on friendzone i did so because i wanted to connect with like minded people i am no longer working on the idea but who know maybe i will work on it again someday maybe in it original form or another way to fix depression but i still feel the need to come up with a framework to be le broken in a world that requires all of u to be perfect i am sure all of you who have suffered know one very contradicting thing you know that you are not alone in your pain you know that you are not the only people who want to reach out you are not the only one who just want to have a simple life and connect with someone who will never judge you for who you are my current startup doe not solve the issue that i care so much about but being in a lot of pain right now i recognize the need to reach out not just for other people but more than ever in a long time for myself that is why i want to build a startup with a company culture that embrace freedom for employee i want to create a culture where people do not feel trapped by what they are doing i want people to improve their life just like i did i want them to have a place to belong and i want to create a place where you can be who you are that is why i am looking to build a team for pigment and let people work from wherever they want to leaving germany and moving to the philippine wa a great help for me i needed a place to escape to i felt trapped in a world where i had no opportunity in life company and government would make it seemingly impossible to work somewhere else i want to build a startup that enables you and me to work from wherever you feel that your heart will heal if you want to know more about pigment look at our pitch deck if you want to connect with me in any way be it to chat talk about pigment or play some game online please feel free to reach out to me via andreas pigment io or pigment slack com do not let yourself be restricted by your fear or doubt you have nothing to lose a steve job pointed out you are already naked there is no reason not to follow your heart do not think about what you are expected of to be doing think about what you want to do with your life i may be broke right now and still lost in some way but i am closer to a place where i belong you have that place a well nobody is supposed to take that away from you you are not alone we all share the journey to happiness i love you i am proud of you for staying strong,depression

2.3245893,-0.103355706,unmotivated wasted of a year and not sure how to get back on my foot i am not really sure where to start with all of this so i will try to explain my situation a best a i can currently i am year old guy unemployed and not in college in high school i had a lot of really close friend that i wa around all the time at i fell into the fun and joy to me of pot drinking and party while not going uncontrollable habit i did fairly decent in class usually maintaining a b average a high school went on i grew to branch out with friend and just hangout with anyone i enjoyed being around instead of the cliche trying to be popular idea i never really had a girlfriend but i have had many short term relationship that just never seemed to work towards the end of my senior year you could say i stopped caring what other people thought and grew apart from the main group of friend i hung out with mini the close friend i had i would try and go branch out and just talk to anyone that i could somewhat hold a relationship with the others just thought i wa weird and disrespectful for whatever reason then before i know it i am getting ready to graduate and move apart from all the people that i would never have to deal with again i then wa planning to go to college at a university that really interested me that summer before college wa by far the most fun i ever had in my life for the first half i went to a few music festival smoked and drank with my best friend from early childhood together we were inseparable it wa by far the best relationship i have held with anymore towards the second half of summer he traveled then moved into college a month or so earlier than myself during this time i met a really amazing girl that finally understood me when thing got serious with her i stopped smoking and mostly drinking entirely one exception wa a trip to the beach with of my close friend the relationship lasted for maybe a month then she moved away due to home issue with her dad this broke me entirely because it felt like almost everything wa perfect i decided to then move on from this and look forward to college which wa only a week away the next week one of my old high school friend who i got into a fight with reached out to me and apologized a did i so we were cool again and attending the same college the weekend before class started we were always around each other sense we did not know many others there i knew a few junior there that we would always go to their house and chill and of course i started smoking pot again class started that monday after the first month wa amazing then thing started to spiral out of my control party or smoking wa almost happening day a week while we had class monday to thursday it is hard to remember how my performance in school wa then but i wa still attending class but my mind wa far out of place i met a few friend my age that went to a different high school near mine and we started to just do some really dumb but fun shit at the time in this time i met maybe girl that i thought i liked but none of the relationship turned to anything a drinking smoking continued to go on my mind could not handle it anymore i stopped smoking drank lightly but did not sleep much so i wa not healthy lost weight and started to act weird my friend noticed it but did not directly say anything to me i had a date with a girl that i finally thought wa a match took a weekend away from the close buddy i had for whatever reason they seemed worried a if i wa going to do something bad or even suicide but i did not know what wa going on i felt so euphoric i had some crazy thought and action from here on the next morning after the date i found myself just going crazy which i did not realize and next thing i know i am at a hospital with iv in my arm and blood test running i could not calm down and did not know what really happened i had my laptop out and reached out to two of my closest friend and said i do my know when i will be able to talk to you but i love you after this they took away all my tech and i wa sent to a psych section of the hospital then to be moved to a psychiatric hospital to stay a week i thought i had no fit and truly thought i wa completely fine til they told me i wa experiencing a hypo manic episode where i wa out of my own control they doped me up and from then on thing were never the same i felt miserable a if i would never be caught out in this situation helpless after the short stay i wa then moved to a house to recover where i had no connection to the outside but where i did meet a few similar people i grew close to them and they helped me thru it for more day that i wa there all this time my friend knew a small portion of the situation i wa so excited to finally go back home this classified a a medical withdraw i came home went to work where i used to for a month then decided to stop and try to relax and set my mind straight the medicine they had me taking wa entirely too strong not narcotic and nobody close to me thought i wa remotely the same person i wa because this incident i wa a mirror shattered into a thousand piece i could not focus or stay still for more then an hour all my friend were in college and here i wa stuck at home i did not really talk much or say anything sat around home only talking to family at dinner or when needed to do something day by day i started to slowly recover but i grew apart from every friend i thought i had in college high school and did not see them i hardly saw any of the close friend i had and fell into an aftermath of depression having no where to go this all happened over a year ago and i have never fully recovered i have not been with a girl in a year seen my best friend maybe time in the past year only been around family this hurt from going to having so much fun being socially engaged to life and now it is like i do not even exist to anyone that wa once close to me all i currently do is play video game with online people that i have met that is the only somewhat social thing i do when i talk to them i do not know how to engage back into life i ca not let another year pas where i have absolutely done nothing i know this hurt my family to see there once active son now doing absolutely nothing with his life i need to make a change i have found myself recently cry randomly at time when i stop and think what am i actually doing with my life i need advice and help on what to do i know there is a part inside of me that i just need to find again i am just lacking the motivation and want to overcome this to come out on top this wa extremely long i know but it would mean a lot to even here some feedback thanks,depression

1.9606025,0.12812029,rant i try and help people when there not happy i even did it for someone who attempted to beat me up my sister had severe depression and almost killed herself and i have been so scared of pretty much anyone committing suicide i have run into people i despise with all my heart but i will never wish death upon anyone unless it is justified my sister is probably one of the most important people in my life or if not the most important person in my life i wa when this all happened and i wa not intelligent and all i knew wa she tried to kill herself me at that age just coped by playing video game i did not really understand how severe this wa till we went to visit her and my parent left to talk to the counselor people about her progress when she started cry and telling my how this place wa like hell and want to leave she just cryed and cryed and it scared me in a way i thought she wa insane or something i did not even understand where she wa then eventually realised it wa a mental hospital i for a little while hated my parent because they did not ever go into detail of what that wa maybe it wa my fault for not being intelligent enough to understand but i still hated them i ca not actually recall if this happened before or after my sister is hospital visit because some event can be so traumatic that your brain way of coping with it is it will attempt to prevent you from remembering it i wa at my dad is house and my step mom sheila came over at the time my dad wa already broken up with her and told u our other sister katlyn wa dead this wa when i got a real stab in the gut with life i knew exactly what wa going on and goddamn did i wish i did not i cryed so much only showing it to my step dad once because i could not bear it on her birthday a couple year back my dad told me to be strong and i tried and it did work for a fair amount of time th grade i hated most of my family and wa pretty depressed did not want to make friend did not do my school work and spent most of my time by myself i met a friend named elijah because my dad wanted me to do a sport and marching band seemed more appealing then a traditional sport it started after the th grade school year during the summer so i did it i did not talk to anyone about my problem and focused on helping others because it made me feel good th grade it appeared to be going good i had a love interest and she felt the same for me i befriended a person from th who talked to me but i did not like me being a persistent fuck tried to avoid him for the whole year until th where i gave him a shot he turned out to be a really nice guy his name is derek then the summer after the th grade school year struck marching band started up my friend derek joined and elijah wa still there my love interest i did not talk to that much in the th grade marching band year but invited me to hangout with her and her sister hannah with elijah i wa not very interested at the time but i started to grow feeling for this girl elijah and hannah were dating at the time and encouraged the idea so i decided i will give it a shot our first show came around and my love interest asked elijah to ask for her if i wanted to sit next to her on our show bus i said yes obviously because it seemed like a good opportunity so we are on the bus and she start cuddling with me that then became a staple every bus trip from then on thing started to go down hill she wa oddly violent in some way she would do thing like stabbing herself with stuff in her backpack like pencil metal object and other miscellaneous stuff i did not like that so i would stop her and she sort of thought it wa funny or attractive so she did it a lot then when i tried to prevent her she would stab me i liked it because it wa sort of cute and the stab would release endorphin that would obviously make me happy she got worse and worse it wa a pretty secretive thing until my friend derek is halloween party came around her hannah and elijah and many others went we were very comfortable with each other at the time so we showed a lot of psa with cuddling and stuff we went for a walk and it sort of turned into the usual she would hurt herself and then hurt me i did not realize until my friend elijah got legitimately mad and yelled at my love interest to stop hurting me we both disregarded him because we thought he did not have the right to say how we can be because it is our relationship eventually we ran into a situation where we could not see each other to much anymore a very close family friend if mine died and i got sad from that without being around my love interest no endorphin were being released at the same rate so i did what i felt i should do i did it myself i felt ashamed and told elijah he wa very saddened by it so i felt even worse then my love interest who i told were cat scratch she obviously saw through my lie and started cry i felt like the scum of the earth the person i cared about the most i made sad i told her i would never do it again and that i love her she left me and ha not talked to me even now i wa so sad about it but my friend were going to bad time a well i wanted to be some sort of hero so i helped a much a a could but i did not help myself which i should of done now i barely have reason to be sad anymore but i still feel sad it is taken it is toll and i think after this post i am going to go get help i really just needed to get this out there before i am most likely gone at a hospital or some sorta thing i really do not know what is going to happen to me but i am going to hope for the best but i want to thank a few special people in my life i love you all so much and thank you i finally feel motivated to get the help i deserve if it wasnt for you some by just being my

-3.6614215,-0.64324224,friendless at and i think it is all my fault i had a bit of a breakthrough in concept and wanted to share my perspective delete me or whatever if this break rule x b for most of the last year i have found my social life getting smaller and smaller today i essentially have no friend sure i have colleague at work people i talk to etc i am not an outcast anywhere and i do not have social anxiety though i am shy in new situation and with new people ten year ago i got married five year ago i had a kid but today i look back on who i wa year ago vibrant energetic active socially alive and wonder where it went x b at some point and i do not know if it wa one thing that triggered this or a series of thing but at some point i turned a weird corner i began to convince myself and eventually truly believed that people extending invitation to me to join them for party or dinner or anything that these people were simply being polite but that they did not really want me to go they would say oh yeah come along we are going to a movie or out for beer or over to so and so is house but i thought or felt or knew that it wa not sincere and they were just being polite but they actually wanted or hoped that i would decline and since i recognized this about the invitation since i knew it wa false i would politely decline no thank you i ca not go to that party no thank you i am busy and wo not be able to join you for dinner i did not need to make thing awkward they wanted me to decline right so i did right x b it probably started small but more and more over the year i have declined invitation to just about everything it is gotten to the point where i know with certainty that i do not belong at this event or that get together or the neighborhood barbecue or the parent club at my kid school even when i force myself to go to thing i stand away from other people because i know deep in my heart that no one actually wanted to see me there i will just hang out here in the corner until it is over i wo not bother anyone since i ought not have come in the first place x b but here is the breakthrough maybe i do not know but maybe the reason i do not have any friend anymore is because those friend i had got sick of me saying no thank you to every invitation and eventually stopped inviting me and maybe the people who are just being polite now actually would not mind or care whether i went to the party and most likely the reason i do not have any friend anymore is because i have convinced everyone i know that i am the asshole and i am the one who doe not want to be their friend when all they were doing wa being outgoing cordial inclusive and trying to connect with me x b i have spent so many year teaching myself that i did not belong in other people is world and now i believe it or at least now i have made it come true i could have belonged but i kept denying and denying and now what i claimed to be the case ha happened for real and it is too late i ca not call everyone up and say whoop and hope they will take me back no in my stupidity i have made it clear to everyone i have ever known that i am just a rejective person who ha no room for others x b and now i have hit a point in my life where i do not see much of a way back i am a teacher the only people i know now are my colleague who all have their own life and my student who i am not going to be friend with anyway and i am married to someone who ha a million friend and i have a kid my spouse like me our kid like me for now but those do not really count x b it feel a little good to acknowledge the specificity of my life is failure in all this it also feel a little horrible to know that i fucked up my existence so profoundly and my decent health willing i could have another year of this ahead of me x b anyway i just wanted to take a moment to put my thought into the ether i do not know you you do not know me there is no need to say anything if you have even bothered to read this i just felt like getting it out of my head i guess,depression

0.7738832,-0.17714773,is it possible to use in moderation the answer is yes and i am proof tired of the weak minded saying moderation doe not exist with opiate or other hard drug that statement is true though only for those who say it in reality it is actually possible to do indulge in moderation but what about addiction i can hear you say well of course that possibility is well a possibility but what about the other way around why ca not you become addicted to using in moderation develop a code a system for yourself and it will become who you are use everyday you make that your code your system you will be an addict in no time use is moderation you make that your code your system you will live the best of both world a junkie and a respected member of society it is what you decide to do with yourself but once a code is followed long enough it becomes who you are you can become addicted or you can become someone who us in moderation so we are all on the same page this is the definition of moderation mod er ate being within reasonable limit not excessive or extreme i have been using opiate for over year in the beginning i did not have the sort of thinking that i have now and what i am sharing with you i fell victim to addiction very early on i wa like you saying moderation ca not exist with this the high is just too good after year of everyday use i finally got help shipped out to a day inpatient rehab where i learned more about myself than i have in my whole life combined i did not want help quitting opiate my whole life i wanted help understanding addiction and my specific underlining issue that got me to the point where i must be fucked up every hour of every day i learned a lot while in rehab but i knew that it wa not the end of my indulging i knew that i would not be clean for life i knew there would be a day after my day rehab hiatus that opiate and i would be reunited i lost nearly everything a an addict i would not let that happen again it is been roughly year since i wa released from rehab i follow a code now that inhibits me from falling back into full blown addiction it is called moderation i am no stranger to the wonderful feeling of getting high on opiate and i am definitely no stranger to the consequence and backlash one is dealt in active addiction moderation is like having the best of both world i can live a perfectly normal life now and still get high i do it like this on the st of every month i will buy one op oxycodone that is all i allow myself to have and buy from there i am free to do whatever with it i could take the whole thing split it into or piece and take a piece every day until it is gone it doe not matter what i decide to do with it once it is gone it is gone until the next st of the month i usually just split it into equal about mg each piece and i will take a piece of the st the nd and the rd so yes i will be high for straight day well mg doe not really get you that high a nice little comfortable buzz is more accurate but you are using day in a row that is not moderation it is my code and therefore i make the rule compared to year ago when i wa at my worst using mg a day i would say that this is a huge difference for the best the best part about moderation is you do not get labeled a a junkie anymore hell my entire family still think i am clean so do all my friend i live the best of both world now and you can too take care fam,drug_addiction

2.2870126,1.3158771,scripping drug in sixty london by barbateboy i first used heroin in i wa year old i had previously used hashish and amphetamine and wa interested in all drug i had read cocteau de quincy kerouac and borough and wa ready to try new experience i met a junkie called gaoler and after much persuasion he agreed to share his scrip my first hit wa speedball a mixture of heroin and cocaine i injected it mainline it wa amazing i had the strongest high ever i wa not hooked but from then on until i wa i regularly fixed mixture of heroin and cocaine i spent an entire weekend holed up in a bedsit off westbourne grove shooting up heroin and a large amount of cocaine on monday i went in to work a a driver delivering mm movie to ship s cinema towards the end of the day i began to swell up i got fatter and fatter i felt rough but if it had not been for the swelling i doubt i would have taken my girlfriend advice and gone to casualty i wa admitted and treated with piriton an anti allergy remedy i wa discharged after a week from then on i wa allergic to cocaine it probably saved my life although i wa unwell for the next year i continued to use heroin but switched to methedrine a the speed component in my high all of the drug i used were obtained legally on doctor s prescription from a clutch of chemist around london there wa boot at piccadilly bliss in kilburn john bell croyden in wigmore st and a few others very few chemist stocked these drug and so over time i ran into most junky who were scripping it wa a small world there were the medical personnel for whom proximity and ready supply overcame scruple ex military and sailor who started raiding field kit or who had smoked opium on tour fool like myself on a false pilgrimage for self exploration or simply to indulge personal hedonism also a few tourist from country with harsher drug regime there seemed to be very few route into this closed scene which wa almost entirely separate from the growing hippy cannabis and acid scene a camaraderie existed and we would gossip and discus which doctor were cool and which were severe it wa possible to boost a loan if one overused and ran out before the next scrip became due the drug were of course pure british pharmaceutical or bp the heroin came by the grain which is about one sixteenth of a gram consisting of six tiny tablet called jack which perhaps gave rise to the expression to jack up on private prescription it cost one and tuppence a grain the cheapest hit in town half a jack wa a much a a non user could stomach the cocaine wa a shining white powder a bit like crushed mothball fresh syrinx and needle came with every scrip there wa very little re use i met many people from taxi driver to set designer who held responsible job and lived otherwise normal life about a year later i became aware that i could hear my heart beating it wa like a clock ticking in my ear denial came easily to me so my lifestyle of indulgence did not change nor did i check it out a i wa afraid of being cut off even so i did not regard myself a a junkie i had many friend amongst hippy and non user who had a horror of the fixing world and i took pain to keep the part of my life separate for the same reason eventually the ticking became so loud that a one night a group of hippie friend heard it and tracked the source to me they wanted to take me to hospital but i wa running some hashish to the coast and did not want to fall foul of these particular customer i insisted they take me to waterloo and a they watched me cross the concourse i collapsed and wa rushed into st thomas s hospital it wa pericardium inflammation of the heart bed rest for two month and marked finally a change in my habit i stopped shooting speed about this time i took lsd for the first time and realized there wa more to life and consciousness and so i started to make a determined effort to wean myself off heroin also a sea change had occurred the tabloid press had got all judgmental about the practice of prescribing drug wilson s government impotent in other respect needed to be seen a effective cocaine wa the first to be stopped then heroin and finally even physepton methadone were removed from the prescribable drug list and almost overnight all junky were cut off from their supply the contraband trade in chinese heroin mushroomed nothing pure about it a wrap of brown white and black unrefined opium powder which had to be ground and the boiled in a spoon and sucked into the syringe through a wadge of cotton wool there wa no way to ass the strength of the dose over the next year i lost about six friend to overdose all experienced junky the whole junkie scene exploded it became a pushed drug and the number of user grew a they got younger measured by effect heroin will always be one of the cheapest drug and being addictive one of the most sustainable and profitable market for gangster the violence spilled over into the entire drug scene there wa a guy called micheal de frietas styled micheal x who set up a gang who hit dope dealer violently ripping off drug and money he wa eventually hanged in jamaica for murder anyway by the whole love in wa well and truly over me i took the hippie trail overland to india and the hashish cure i spent about a year there i cleaned up i could see the junky and speed freak before they recognized me and i stayed away from them i did smoke a huge amount of high grade hashish and eventually hitched home from katmandu with a pregnant girlfriend we were broke but we picked hop then apple and started a new life a a family i went into business a a builder and she trained a a teacher and neither of u touched white drug again i think getting clean depends on various factor first one ha to hit bottom and realize a change is necessary then one ha to be able to change one s social geography someone cleaning up is a challenge to junky and they can be a bit like vampire coming around all the time trying to seduce you back to smack they only need to get lucky once and then they don t have to think of their own weakness then most important of all one ha to fill the void with a new mission a passion a raison d etre i think after getting clean one remains a non using junkie for at least five year and unless there are new horizon objective whatever in one life the sheer meaningless make it very difficult to stay clean,drug_addiction

0.34431088,-0.5722001,two failed attempt rd time is the charm i have had suicidal thought since i am a high school drop out or my country is equivalent to high school year old living in my mom is basement and unemployed and trying to finish high school had a year of obligatory military service year ago when i wa done i wa going to finish high school i failed the motivation wa not there that is when the suicidal thought appeared from to i wa living with my mom leeching money off her for food i did not want to tell anyone about my problem i am allergic to that kind of attention in she got me a part time job and i gave it a shot had the job from to and i guess thing were looking up i still thought about suicide pretty much every day but it wa not intense enough to actually go through with it it wa more of a safety net if it get bad i will just kill myself right problem solved september i quit my job life wa not going anywhere i did not have a shred of motivation to do anything and i could just end it and be done with it so i got drunk but the drunker i got the le i wanted kill myself so i just fell asleep next day i figured i have money saved up and i will live off it still living with my mom and when i am broke i will either try and kill myself again or actually try and do something in that period where i wa living off my saving i came in contact with a girl online she had problem of her own anxiety and other thing and i told her that i wa suicidal we hit it off pretty good but then i started thinking that now i am just getting more people involved in my misery i do not want to leave more friend behind so i stopped talking to her before any real friendship i went off to kill myself it failed and i kinda knew it would low success rate i wanted it to be a clean a possible and it had to be doable in the basement woke up the next day realising it did not work contacted this girl and she wa glad i came back she wa really worried and even called the police i wa reluctant to tell her that i had attempted suicide but i did eventually a she wanted an explanation we became good online friend for the next couple of month she wa the only person i had daily contact with and we would talk for hour every day she made me happier meanwhile i tried applying for job with no luck and barely any work experience living in a small town where knowing people get you the few job available i know no one no social network my suicidal thought got more intense meanwhile she had met someone else online and did not pay the same attention to me anymore i decided to just delete her from skype and everything regretted that decision like day later and came crawling back to her explaining how i felt she forgave me with the intense suicidal thought i started to get a bit destructive towards her started poking fun at her and eventually said really mean thing she got really mad and while we still talked it wa not the same i felt really guilty an apology did not mean anything a i knew what i wa saying at this point she wa really my best friend and i had hurt her feeling in september this year i started high school again just class that i am missing to graduate still unemployed leeching money off my mom for food something i am really ashamed of school doe not go so well no motivation i am beginning to think what is the point the friend i had hurt before doe not talk to me a much we mostly link funny picture to each other i felt really guilty and my suicidal thought got more intense last sunday i removed her from my friendslists i had ruined a good friendship and i would probably be mean to her in the future anyway she sends me a message on the phone and i explain short why i just removed her or half of it what i told her wa true but i did not tell her that i am killing myself the real reason for removing her because she ha been really worried for me i make my preparation i feel i need to make i play some video game still go to school on monday on tuesday i feel i need to explain myself further to this friend making sure she know i did not just try to be an asshole once again still not saying anything about attempting suicide after that i really tried killing myself made it a tight a i possibly could i wa listening to music the music started becoming distorted and weird breathing became difficult splitting headache many minute passed it is not working the way it is supposed to i am not doing it right i abort in fear of just doing damage and not end up dying i look in the mirror bloodshot eye and my skin had red area like tiny blood vessel had been broken it is day later i am not sure if i am trying again i mean if you really really want to die it is simple right i guess i want to live after all i feel like a failure no motivation living in my mom is basement having her pay for my food year old ca not even handle fucking high school i need a job but i feel like no one would hire me ca not even kill myself i ditched my best friend and i am scared if i come crawling back to her now she would just ignore me thinking maybe i am playing som retarded game with her to hurt her even more it really make me want to try a rd time i wa hoping to be able to kill myself in this basement but i think it wo not work i need to go somewhere and put myself in a situation where i ca not abort the suicide attempt going to look for an area where i can hang myself i also feel like i should tell my mom my brother and sister but i am already a burden on my mom i do not want to burden her more with the fact that her oldest son ha attempted suicide i think she know i am troubled with something it is a really a dick move to kill myself i know my mom ha supported me for so long ha not thrown me out or anything she ha also lost a brother to suicide so losing her oldest son would be really devastating i guess i should tell my family and maybe tell the friend i ditched but fuck i am scared she would tell me to fuck off i do not know what i would do if it turn out like that thanks for reading,suicidality
