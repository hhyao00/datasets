-6.3458266,17.09839,time to change or at least admit some issue and come out the shadow alcohol drug first post on reddit i am going to apologise in advance a this may not be the most structured body of text ever and it ended up far longer than i hoped to begin with this is probs about of what i wanted to put but if anyone want to go deeper into this i would happily oblige right now but here is instalment one im live just south of london uk been smoking pot daily since about always enjoyed a good drink but can count the day without booze in the last year on one hand and at least time a week i get on the coke and i think about it after that nd beer is finished every time the big problem here is deffo the drink it wa fine at a couple beer a night a crate would last a week but for last year it gotten to the stage i buy drink all hen drink my housemate leftover then replace the next day then here is no drink to borrow when i finish the tinnies so it onto the martini desert wine champaign anything leftover that no one will drink and any mixer to dilute it a long a i can get to a sufficiently wobbly state to sleep well ko but hangover are not a thing anymore which male it easier to feed the habit but i guess these are just my current release i have pretty much always an addict for something and i have realised a lot about damaging your reward system in your head from over stimulation and apparently smoking too much i suffer from anxiety and probably depression but have always kinda tried to avoid admitting to depression always better it by convincing myself that a bit of sunshine music and forcing myself to laugh will clear up any bad mood ha worked so far i guess but now them lonely evening are just met with a bottle but one think i wanna make clear is unless it the last thing to help me that giving up smoking weed is not an option it capped all of my temper issue ad eating problem over the year and if i order the right concentrate i can keep my anxiety at arm length and financially it doe not impact me at all i have been lurking around r addiction r alcoholism and a few other related sub i have pretty much read every single post and commented to all those who i felt i could share some insight on in a hope that like usual helping others may make me feel better instead i have come to realise i have a problem and no matter how much i try going to my mate to stop me popping down the shop for a pack or making that call at midnight on a school night and being up till am chewing my face off then it basically being down to a coin flip a to wether i go to work or not so it time to do something i really hate the idea of aa meeting i do not do social situation much a it is and i do not think that would help me i know i would convince myself im good after a few session and i know everything i could know and stop i know that sound narrow minded but i am incredibly strongly opinionated sometimes and just make something in my head twitch at he idea counselling is probs a possibility i am aware of that but i tried to get cbt year ago and took a year to get a half assed appointment from a fresh graduate who had never smoked a joint in his life i still have a job i do not loathe which is better than most previous job but i am on my last leg with the company after being here for a little over a year i have been a week without smoking cigarette and do not even use tobacco in my joint but i am starting to get into financial trouble again and i just cannot say no to anything when drunk tried quitting a lot in the last month or two but once i do a few day i think i can handle one drink or i can handle a friday night but obviously i cant and kinda hoping you guy might shed some insight a to why or how to start changing it taken me week but i have finally posted to you guy thanks to anyone who listened to the end and sorry you had to endure said word,addiction

-35.28235,22.136696,week sober so far so good i have intended to quit many time to no avail the longest break i can recall in the last year is probably week i have found that when i psyche myself up to quit i find way to avoid it i told myself i would quit on march did not then march th nope maybe april meh i had a house guest i wa expecting to arrive last week who is straight edge recovering addict so i decided to finish my stash and show her some respect by not sneaking off to smoke or have the house smell she actually never ended up staying with me but i have not smoked since last tuesday one week strong i am also trying to quit smoking cigarette and have not had one since sunday so day strong there i keep saying to myself you are strong you are healthy you do not need to smoke i have also acknowledged that it wo not actually change or improve anything it is just a distraction from whatever it is i am likely avoiding i am approaching this in a similar way that i approached going vegan almost year ago i did not tell myself you will never eat meat again i just took it day by day and made a conscious effort to control my choice and before i knew it week in i knew it would be a lifelong path for me i no longer wanted to consume animal product i say that to draw comparison because anytime i overwhelmed myself with expectation you will start your detox in t minus day etc smoke all the thing before you must quit i got too anxious and abandoned the plan but when i just say eh i wo not call my dealer today i wo not buy a new pack of cigs today i am able to actually have the self control to make the change i claim to so badly want so that is my little nugget of wisdom do not overwhelm yourself with the prospect of forever quitting something you are so familiar with or something you perhaps still really enjoy just take it one day at a time and allow your mind and body to adjust accordingly and when those little saboteur say wouldammit i want to smoke which wa totally happening to me le than hour ago try and change environment to change your focus go for a walk at sunset work on a puzzle or doodle clean go exercise call up someone you have not talked to in a while hell even go to target and have a little retail therapy i absolutely would love to smoke right now but i am enjoying my clearheadedness i feel like my emotion are leveling back out i do not feel so indecisive apathetic and anxious a usual i am also enjoying going to bed earlier i usually stay up really late and just keep smoking and waking up feeling more rested i am also enjoying eating my dinner and maybe a post dinner snack feeling full and content rather than grazing endlessly regardless of my hunger level the cycle of always wanting to be smoking is maddening and i shame myself most of the time anyway so it is nice to not have that feeling of you dummy you are wasting time money getting high every night or you are poisoning your lung cigarette are nasty love this sub and community of support would love to hear feedback and opinion from your experience or struggle,addiction

39.759937,46.311985,warning this is long and perhaps familiar i wrote this to myself about a year ago though i wa fairly depressed at the time i feel world better now and i see this letter a one of the mental growth spurt that ha helped lead me to closer the state of inner balance i ve been working to achieve maybe it will help you maybe you ll take comfort in finding a little bit of yourself in here who know the letter saying i over think thing is an understatement take my happiness for example i think about it so much it make me unhappy such a vicious cycle it go something like this i know i wa happy at some point in high school and definitely earlier i remember sitting in my parent den in front of the computer thinking about how if i died the next day i would die a happy person is that one fleeting memory that my currently unhappy self is clinging to i know i wasn t happy all the time in high school i remember cry because i wa ugly because i didn t have enough friend because i didn t do well on a test or in some class i fought with my mother but i wa comfortable i didn t worry about money or politics or my place in the world but now now i don t know i m married i own a house well part of a house anyway i have a career one that pay me far more than i deserve and sometimes i feel like a failure i feel like i wa happier before when i wa in high school confident in my popularity top of my class good at everything i tried and in the first few year in my first career again confident in my ability liked by my peer going somewhere but what happened is it the world becoming an adult and realizing that the world is a terrible unjust unfair place that hard work doesn t really mean success that successful people rarely get there because they deserve it feeling like everything is broken the government healthcare crime the economy real estate wall street and that there s nothing i can do about it is it me are these just part of the pain of becoming an adult realizing i m not a kid anymore that my life is essentially meaningless that i ll never make history or the million dollar question can i blame all of this on mj did it make me lazier did it make me more cynical more aware easier to depress more thoughtful honestly i m not sure and there i go thinking on something that thinking can t solve if i m unhappy i should figure out what i need to be happy and do it or i should quit whining go with the flow and remind myself that i have a great life i m mostly healthy i love my family and i m not poor that make me better off than of the planet today i m opting for the later le whiny path but tomorrow or the next day i ll go through the same mental marathon again which brings u back to that million dollar question what about the mj how doe it fit into this thoughtful picture this year i will be though i ve done a lot of fun thing in the past few year i can t help but feel like i ve been clouding those memory with smoke there s something wonderful about smoking it s like i get to hit pause on all my worry sometimes sometimes instead of sweet release i end up with crippling paranoia but for the most part smoking let me relax enjoy the sky the world around me they say you should stop and smell the rose smoking let me do that for a price it seems my gene are not those of an addict but an over indulger quitting is physically easy i ve done it off an on for the last few year then again all addict think they can quit at any time they just need a good enough reason the famous rock bottom but i ll never hit rock bottom smoking there s no bottom to hit beyond this intense inner monologue something i m pretty sure i always had but smoking enhances it doesn t really have any negative effect on my life or doe it thinking thinking thinking even if it s not caused by smoking it s not made any better by smoking perhaps the bigger concern is that it give me one more thing to think about i think about smoking all the time when i m relaxed i think smoking would make this better when i m bored i think smoking would make this better when i m unhappy i think smoking would make this better but all smoking doe is give me an hour or two of mush brain followed by craving to consume anything within reach is that really so great and yet here i am thinking about how i d love to leave work and go sit in the hammock for a few hour just looking at the cloud sure that s not a bad thing but it is when you do it every day when you let the house go to pot you stop hanging out with your friend and forget your sister s birthday then it s a problem and yet besides the fact that having a clean house make me happier to be there what s it matter so what if i have a dirty house i have nothing to smoke tonight but i still don t want to hang out with claire and i probably would have forgotten my sister s birthday anyway the truth lie somewhere between thinking the drug ha no effect on me and blaming it for all my problem but where damned if i know i like smoking there have been high time in the past few year that i would add to my lifetime collection watching the sunset the plane the moon from my hammock my oasis wandering around my parent s old yard reminiscing on my childhood walking to the library watching the sun glint off the ocean kayaking back to the cabin house with my husband having spacey discussion with him under the star i m almost in tear thinking of how wonderful smoking can be but what a fiend it make me i smoke all weekend and end up dangerously depressed on monday because i never smoke before or at work i smoke before visiting friend who may or may not notice that i m not playing with a full deck i think about it all the time when i m trying to cut back and my husband doesn t like it i don t want him to be disappointed in me or angry at me but at the same time i can t help but feel that smoking make me more like him unconcerned with minor chore able to just go with the flow and be happy in the moment but if i m not the driven one in our relationship someone ha to be at the theoretical wheel and i can t be when i m high so why should i quit i might not get any real benefit from smoking but i guess you could say the same about video game can i honestly only smoke when i have nothing better to do i m not sure but if the house is dirty smoking will make it more fun to clean if i have thing i need to get done i ll get them done and reward myself with a little fresh air round and round we go one side reminds me that i m trading tomorrow for today and my future for right now i won t get healthy or end the paranoid thinking if i don t stop i ve already proven to myself that i can t have it and not smoke it if you re going to quit there s no time like the present then the other side rationalizes that the end is near that we ll go grocery shopping tonight and then pay my friend a visit but this will be it then i ll take a break the winter is coming and i hate being out in the cold so it will be easier i m really only smoking until daylight saving when it s too dark to go out anyway just one more month and then i m through but i said that last time,addiction

32.94604,39.40181,loneliness a a trigger i can tell from reading post on here that some people are triggered by social event they will go to a wedding office party restaurant or night club and see friend or colleague drinking so they join in then there are people like me who is drinking problem is actually the opposite the large majority of the time i binge drank it wa me alone on my couch drinking large amount of vodka or whisky or rum and watching tv or video on youtube or writing embarassing drunken nonsense on facebook most of the time i blamed it on boredom but i think actually it is really loneliness that is the main issue year ago i had friend and a job when i wa not working i met my friend at the movie theater coffee shop restaurant the beach they rarely drank so alcohol wa not an issue i wa a happy man then i gradually started binge drinking alone in my apartment i lost some of my friend because of my alcoholism while some other friend simply grew older and got married and have family to raise now so basically i think my loneliness and lack of social life is what push me sometimes to just go to the liquor store and go home with a big bottle and have fun that way but if i had actual friend and a job and everything i probably would rarely feel lonely and not need to spend my evening alone with a bottle i would be drinking coffee with friend instead of getting wasted alone on my couch or bed it is a vicious cycle i binge drink cause i have nothing better to do and nobody to hang out with but at the same time the reason why i have nothing to do or see is because alcoholism ha almost ruined my life and made me lose touch with a healthy social life alcohol is sometimes seen a a solution to a problem and then you realize alcohol is also causing the problem to begin with,alcoholism

3.4796598,3.415813,on my second week without drinking not sure where to go from here and honestly i have some doubt about aa ok first of all i would not consider myself to be sober i am not week sober but am week sober from alcohol i quit drinking for a harm reduction reason i wa having scary symptom and would like to consider seeing a doctor soon to get my liver and blood work done but i feel so much better and the idea of a drink no longer seems appealing however a large part of that is probably because i have not committed to long term abstinence but am taking it a day at a time but yeah i have found that an abnormal cluster of symptom occurs when i drink hard for day on end and i have a much more difficult time controlling alcohol use than any other drug i have used it wa making me nonfunctional at work and it did not even feel like a normal hangover but constant feeling weak sick etc even after day of no drinking all the while seeing people twice my age drink more and have no symptom this all began in the past year i wish to quit drinking x b i do consider myself to be an alcoholic and for the first time in my life i feel like it is unreasonable for me to expect to be able to ever moderate my drinking in the long term on the flip side i do not want to work step but would instead like to work a more evidence based program i am open to anything even the sinclair method which actually requires you to continue drinking but taking an opioid blocker to stop the reinforcement it ha good success rate from study that i have seen my issue with aa is that the step really are no different than john doe is latest self help program book it wa just the first i have gone to a couple of meeting and felt that it felt very scriptural we are taking the big book a some fundamental text reading it aloud and dissecting every sentence felt like when i wa a teen and had to go to bible study i never got anything out of that then and i do not think i could take step seriously something need to be completely evidence based for me to stay out of denial aa is cheap and smart only meet once a week in my area similarly i find therapy to be very pricey for only one hour long exposure every week or two would i be accepted a a true member at aa if i do not work all the step or i take a lose interpretation of them i wo not be drinking and i plan to stop all other drug except for my medical prescribed marijuana but i will be working a program with a therapist combined with the social support of a community like aa but not the step or the big book x b do not get me wrong i have read the big book and can relate to it i just think that it is a bit dated and some of it is pseudoscience,alcoholism

-73.03012,-3.0927136,some of my thought today first real post of my own so please bear with me i am rather new to self reflection on my experience with alcohol reading this naked mind and just understanding that i am supposed to feel and deal with the thing that alcohol took away from me ha been very enlightening taking a look at my thought and feeling from a critical perspective have truly helped me understand just how warped my mind and way of thinking ha subconsciously become i am also extremely relieved to know that some of these fear and feeling that i am experiencing will inevitably subside i wa not born drinking no one did at some point s good grief do i wish i could have a time machine for when this happened i began to consciously say hey this might help me over time my thought process became shorter a the throw of addiction took over i did not stew over a decision to drink or weigh it option with what i might really want to do that day it become a subconscious thought and a feeling something my mind did not grapple with at all because i had already reasoned out why i should so many time before and followed through on it advertisement friend around me hell even t v show reinforced the experience and observation i had it became a part of who i am with no additional thought or feeling that is scary to admit but it is the truth it allowed for so many false feeling and imagination of what alcohol really did for me because i never consciously dealt with what i wa doing a i did it sure there wa after the fact shame and guilt but those did me absolutely no good after the fact if i ca not decide to not drink today when i feel like drinking and weigh out the option how can i possibly expect to change that part of the process i understand now better why i would just say i wo not drink because it hurt me and others before and i absolutely utterly failed at following through on it it did not matter that i could not stop myself when i began drinking or that i wa an addict i could have known all those thing it just did not matter my great hope and comfort i am having now is knowing that or at least believing that if over time this process could become an unconscious process then why ca not the process of what i am feeling now what i am doing now by reflecting on why i do not want to drink and then making the commitment to not do it today eventually my decision to not drink or being afraid of never drinking again but reasoning it out and deciding not to drink today will become just a automatic and ingrained in my very thought and feeling a alcohol eventually did i know it is probably not that simple the process will probably take a very long time but i absofckinglutely refuse to believe this ha probability of occurring i hope that some of you can believe this too a you post your struggle in here it give me great joy to communicate with you that is something i remembered today that i like helping people screw alcohol for taking that from me for so long feeling strong i am not drinking with any of you today,alcoholism

20.79727,32.443985,introduction day sober saturday wa my last day of drinking i am sharing why i stopped in the hope that it will motivate others to abstain or continue abstaining i first started drinking at age i wa super against it since people in my family had drinking problem and i hated being around them when they drank usually to excess i actually made my friend in college based on who also did not drink a few month later we are all watching a hockey game and one of the guy had a case of beer the first beer i absolutely hated and ha to choke down after i actually started liking it by the time i got to the last beer of my share of the pack beer i absolutely had to have more and did not want to stop looking back it is crazy that even from the very first time i drank i had the demon inside of me demanding more within a month my entire life revolved around getting drunk it is been year of heavy drinking since then one day i wa discussing health with a friend he cracked a joke about my liver and i said nah i am still young i am fine he responded with i do not know man nearly year straight of heavy drinking that is got to have done some kind of damage i wa floored because i realized he wa right i started to think about what alcohol had cost me in those year while i wa never arrested or anything of that nature there were still plenty of horrible thing when i dug deeper the biggest issue i noticed wa my mental health depression and anxiety have been about tripled during this entire period of my life after year of college i left despite getting mostly good grade in a tough major i needed a change but what i did not know at the time is that i really just wanted a break from alcohol i stopped drinking for a few month and my life turned completely around of course i wa too dumb to realize why at the time i started drinking again and suddenly it wa worse than ever though i never lost a job from oversleeping or showing up drunk i still bounced from job to job because i wa never happy it took me a long time to realize after being told by a psychiatrist that this depression wa all due to alcohol i have been trying to stop drinking for the past year i would go or day without a drink then go into a complete week long binge all of the lie and hiding of bottle can started really happening at the time i never really thought about it but now it seems so bizarre that i thought it wa normal to plan my life around alcohol and come up with a plan about how many i would say i had when to sober up for a bit and then when to drink myself to sleep after that horrible period i got to a healthier stage i wa still drinking but it wa only day a week just a slow day long buzz i would just drink beer an hour for the entire day drink some more the next day then take a few day off admittedly some of the day turned crazy there were two morning i remember waking up and legitimately being shocked that i wa still alive and made it through the night the past month i have been serious about stopping sadly for the first time in my life i could not choose to stop anymore i would make it a day or two no problem but day wa always viscous for me nothing would go through my head other than the thought of alcohol luckily each time i gave in it wa only for a pack or smaller i found this forum last week and coupled with all of the tip and advice i found researching how to stop drinking i wa able to pull it off what really helped me wa having a game plan to stay occupied for the day my craving were the worst toning it down for a month before hand also helped since i did not get the shake this time when stopping sleep wa horrible for a couple night but it really feel like i have my life back even after day my skin is looking better i know now that the biggest hurdle is maintaining this sobriety by ignoring the voice in my head that tell me it okay to just drink this one night i know now that every time it just start a month long drink fest,alcoholism

-37.503998,26.466309,generalized anxiety what is helpful and not helpful when it come to my personal experience with generalized anxiety disorder or gad nothing is ever the same twice my panic attack are different my anxiety attack may be different but a lot of the time the thing that help me calm down are often helpful step ask question do not be afraid to ask honest question personally i like it when people ask me question about my anxiety especially if their word are calming and supportive this is one of many way that i am able to ground myself when another person in some way affirms that my feeling are viable and that although they may not really understand they do in fact want me to feel safe step physical contact or no physical contact some people do and do not like physical contact during an anxiety or panic attack this often differs from instance to instance a an example when i am in the water and i am swimming and have an anxiety attack i do not want to be touched i feel like that person is going to cause me to drown and that i will die because they are touching me however when i am having a ptsd flashback i want someone to hug me that feeling of being squeezed make me feel secure and safe the best way to figure out what a specific person need to calm down is to ask ask question step help remove the stressor one of the most vital part of helping another person with anxiety is to figure out what the stressor is and help remove it one of my greatest fear always ha been is chicken i have been deathly afraid of them for almost year now and i still ca not stand them when i have an anxiety attack over chicken it is often because of a chicken or chicken noise and it is often best in such instance for me to be removed from the area or the chicken related thing to be removed the best way to find out what the stressor is remove the person from the room allow them to calm down and ask them what scared them step facing your fear is a very scary real thing to u we realize our anxiety or fear may be irrational to others but to u it is very real an very serious do not force people to tell you what is wrong if they do not want to answer and do not force them to encounter their fear one of the biggest no no in my mind is people forcing others with anxiety or phobia to face their fear that is simply not right if they want to face their fear or be open about their anxiety when they are asked they will answer please do not force anyone to do anything they do not feel safe or comfortable doing these are only some of many many step and guideline that can help please feel free to comment,anxiety

-2.0031137,21.834848,i have been experiencing a wide range of symptom lately but i keep getting told it is anxiety intro backstory i will admit i have always been a bit of a hypochondriac i would feel a mild pain a few time and convince myself that my heart wa not healthy i remember a a very young child between there were a few time where i swore i wa having a heart attack and begging my parent to call obviously they were just panic attack i never had panic attack very frequently maybe a couple time a year if that and they would usually only last about minute or le i had one major panic attack that started around pm that went on got worse until later that night when i finally went to the er they said everything wa fine it wa just a panic attack and to stop drinking energy drink and after that i felt fine having an ekg done and knowing that doctor is looked at me and decided i wa fine since then i have had the occasional panic attack very rare and they were brief i usually see a doctor about once a year just to stay on top of my health and it help to soothe my hypchondria a bit more back story i had a cholesteatoma on my left ear drum when i wa ish had two surgery to have it removed it wa removed completely but it let me with a recurring fungal ear infection basically any moisture get in my ear and the infection will pop back up i have been seeing an ear doctor about once a year since those surgery to have my ear cleaned out of the fungal infection i have never experienced any symptom other than a stinky discharge and a full feeling to the ear that disrupts hearing recently the doctor i have been seeing all my life retired i tried seeing a new doctor but he only partially cleaned out the ear and gave me some drop suggesting that the drop will help clear up the rest my old doctor would thoroughly clean my ear each time but hearing that drop could fix it wa great since the cleaning procedure wa incredibly uncomfortable anyway saw that doctor probably about a year ago and took the drop for a bit after my visit and stopped because they did not feel like they were helping recent trouble enough backround information i am year old several month ago close to a year i saw a doctor about a chest pain i would been having i first noticed it when i wa yelling loudly and it caught me by surprise enough to stop me mid yell i tested it out a bit and at the time if i coughed or laughed loudly i could recreate the pain it only hurt when i yelled laughed loudly moved a certain way or coughed and even then it did not hurt every time or much at all the pain wa mild upper left of my chest beneath my left clavical i experience occasional pain on the underside of my left bicep a well but i did not think they were related just trying to be thorough with my symptom i saw a doctor for this pain just to make sure it wa not anything serious had an ekg done checked my blood pressure had a chest x ray done and nothing could be found assuming that it wa not lung or heart related we assumed that it wa skeletal or muscular and i sort of dropped it the doc suggested that it could be stress anxiety related keep in mind from the time i first noticed the pain in my chest until when i saw the doctor wa probably a couple month i waited a good while because the pain wa rarely occuring and like i mentioned it did not really ever hurt just slightly uncomfortable i wa prescribed vistaril something that i wa told to take whenever i wa feeling anxious and that it should help i tried it once or twice but it did not seem to help i wa not having many panic attack anyway so they were not really needed one day after work i noticed a slight dizzniness i think i worked myself up made the dizziness worse and started to panic i went to an urgent care facility and they just checked my blood pressure asked a couple question and assumed i wa getting sick told me to drink plenty of water and rest i felt fine the next day and noticed that my vistaril said on the bottle in big letter can cause dizziness so i assumed that wa it and forgot about it more recently probably about month ago one evening i wa at the grocery noticed a slight dizziness and my leg got weak for a moment but that weakness subsided right away i honestly could have just stumbled or stepped wrong but i started to panic and i rushed home i talked on the phone with a friend and i calmed down since then the dizziness ha been occuring more and more often at this point i am constantly wouldizzy i call it dizzy but it is only noticable when moving my head i can walk just fine the room is not spinning it is hard to describe we have come to the conclusion that it is my ear causing it since i have not had it fully cleaned out in a while i scheduled an appointment with a new ear doctor in the meantime just to check i decided to see a general practicioner just to get his opinion since it wa not an ear symptom that i had ever experienced before they checked my blood pressure and without even looking in my ear suggested that the chest pain and dizziness were probably because i wa stressed or dehydrated so he wa not any help i had a panic attack that day monday and then the next night tuesday tuesday is wa so bad i ended up at the er again they checked my blood pressure and did an ekg and everything looked good we assumed it wa just a panic attack since then i have been having a panic attack almost every day sometimes feeling slightly anxious the entire day and other symptom are popping up here and there current symptom dizziness constant sometimes i get hit with a wave of exhaustion i just feel incredibly tired suddenly and want nothing more than to go to sleep once i noticed that the sleepy episode passed i went from feeling tired but afraid to sleep to normally awake another night i gave in and dozed off but woke up about hour later feeling fine my bowel movement have been a mess i have been going a lot more often than i usually do sometimes after every meal usually diarehea no abdominal pain but i am naseous quite a bit i have absolutely zero apetite sex drive or desire to do anything i have been forcing myself to eat every day but i still have not been eating very much and i am still never craving anything i have looked at porn and i have been completely unaroused i usually ca not stop playing video game but i have no desire at all to play them one night my neck and jaw felt very stiff i have noticed the past few night when laying down there is an unusual heat sensation coming from my face and hand foot it feel hot against the pillow but i do not have a fever and i am not hot to the touch right now my hand are a little sweaty and my foot are under the cover burning i slept decent the night before last but still spent almost the entire day yesterday in bed some sleeping some just laying and relaxing reading reddit i got up and ate played about an hour of video game and started feeling anxious again so i got back in bed and tried to relax until i fell asleep have a strange taste in my mouth currently but it could be from not brushing my teeth in a couple day or resting with my mouth closed you know how that is something about my vision feel off like it feel like there is a delay to my comprehension it feel like i have trouble concentrating i am still able to play game fine so i suppose it could just be the strange dizziness i am feeling which is related to movement of my head i think that is everything it is hard to sleep sometimes but it is hard to get out of bed it is hard to remember to eat and then it is hard to eat i am not vomiting but i have never been much of a vomiter i do not really feel the urge to no extreme chest pain only the occasional mild pain only the occasional mild headache probably due to the lack of water i have been drinking only about a bottle or two a day i have no thirst nothing that should send me to the er just constantly uncomfortable ear doctor and blood test result so throughout all of this i saw a new ear doctor last thursday he say my inner ear is very red and there is a noticable amount of debris he clean it partially and say to clean the rest he will need me to take some ear drop twice a day and see him in a week he doe acknowledge that it could very well be causing my dizziness since i am experiencing these frequent panic attack and other symptom this did not make me feel much better but i will need to do it to clean it out regardless i saw another general practitioner on monday this week to go over my added symptom i told her i would like to get a complete overall look at my health done to see if there is anything going on she order blood test a cbc a cmp a tsh to test my thyroid and a lipid test she also prescribed me cymbalta and xanax cymbalta is meant to ease my anxiety over time and xanax is meant to be taken a needed when i am panicking i had a banana prior to the blood test but the doctor suggested that it probably would not make a difference since it would only affect my blood sugar which would be tested mainly for diabetes i just got the blood test result back and she say everything is completely normal everything she went over all of it and said in her word everything wa istone cold normal no thyroid issue no sign of cancer everything just looked normal i tried to ask her what about my unusual bowel habit my complete loss of appetite my unusual constant panic attack my dizziness and she just think that i got myself worked up into a anxiety episode over the symptom of my infected ear she say to start taking the mg of cymbalta once daily and take xanax a needed to try to break the habit in the meantime i am still experiencing no red flag symptom that would send me to the er but i am afraid to be alone i am afraid to go to work all i want to do is sleep i never want to eat and i am constantly anxious can anxiety really pop up like this could i honestly have worked myself up into this much of an uncomfortable state just through worrying about my ear infection symptom like i said i have had the occasional panic attack before usually at night before bed this is something insane and it is debilitating and wrecking my life i go to the ear doctor tomorrow to have my secondary cleaning i suppose i will have a clearer answer then but i wa hoping to get some of you guy opinion in the meantime ha anyone else run into a week anxiety episode out of nowhere do you guy really think it is my ear and my anxiety i appreciate anyone who take the time to read my story and share their thought,anxiety

whole load of fuckery if you ask me how my childhood wa it wa great i lived between my mother and my father they broke up a few month after i wa born it is not a bad a it sound i didn t know any different yes i wanted my parent to be together but i understood a a child that mummy and daddy didn t love each other anymore when we were kid we would ride our bike with the neighbourhood kid right up until the street light came on at night we knew that wa our queue to go home shower brush our teeth and go to bed back then we didn t understand why our mother and step father would make u go to the far end of the house in our bedroom and keep the hallway door closed we didn t know what that strange smell wa coming from the kitchen at night it didn t smell like any food mum had made for u before back in those day it wa acceptable to smoke inside we didn t know any different in the morning we would wake with our school lunch made we would tie our shoe put on our backpack and walk the kilometer to school through narrow road sometimes we would walk home through the little forrest nothing bad ever happened to u we were smarter than that a kid when that man tried to grab my brother when he wa walking home alone nothing happened because he wa smart enough to run into the forest when another man parked his car over a driveway so i couldn t walk passed i wa smart i didn t take the money he offered me to help him with a job i got passed his car and kept walking home repeating his license plate in my head until i could say it outloud to mum when i got home my friend and i were smarter than the man who exposed himself to u when we were walking to meet mum after she finished work we knew to cross the road so he couldn t drive next to u anymore we knew that when he kept looping back to u in his car that we needed to find a phone and call my mum because this weird man kept trying to talk to u with his penis out but thank god nothing bad ever happened to u we would still do our paper run on the way home from school alone one day our friend down the road would convince me to try to smoke a cigarette how easy it wa to smoke after the first time a long a you held it deep down in your lung for long enough and it wa so easy sometimes mum when you weren t looking i would steal a puff of your smoke when you popped into the dairy and left u in the car waiting for you sometimes i would get some of your tobacco and take it to a friend house and we would teach each other how to roll we were pretty cool a year old knowing how to roll our own smoke of course we got jealous when our new baby sister came you spent le time with u and we could see that she could get whatever she wanted whenever she wanted now i don t know what i did to make you so mad with me that you called dad and his wife telling them that if they didn t come and get me you would kill me yourself it s not like dad wa around anyway by this time in my life dad had only come to visit me twice and he wa married and had a new life now even though we would go down and spend the christmas holiday near him we wouldn t actually stay with him we would spend maybe a few day with him but the rest of the time wa with nana we loved spending time with her i loved spending time with her so when you made that phone call to dad and he said he couldn t take me i wa happy that nana agreed it would be a different lifestyle for me in a tiny little hick town where everyone know everyone and everyone is related to everyone but it wa somewhere i felt wa home until nana got sick and i had to move out there were a few month when we were trying to figure out where i should go because dad still didn t want me and mum seemed happy again so i spent a few month out of school it s all sort of a blur to me where i wa living and who with and when or how long i m not sure if i wa really wanted at dad house but when i wa at dad it wa a full house his wife had child of her own three living at home still and a toddler who dad would adopt no one told me i wa loved like when i wa living with nana but that is ok but nothing bad ever happened to me a year or so later i m sure it wasn t because of me dad and his wife broke up i wa slightly relieved because that meant that i could finally spend time with my dad but work seemed to consume him working hour shift day shift the night shift and having four day off meant that i would get myself up ready for school and make my lunch i didn t want to wake you dad i knew you would be tired sometimes i would even come home and you wouldn t be there so i would even make my own dinner i wa so excited to have you come to my fashion show we put together at school i wa so proud of what i had designed and made with my own hand if only you had of came i wa showing you dad your little girl wa growing up i didn t know there wa a problem until i went to school one day and the teacher asked me why i hadn t showered and why my clothes didn t fit i don t remember what i told them because it wa ok nothing bad ever happened a couple year later when i wa in highschool i played basketball and i wa really good i just wish dad you had come to watch me play more than once bet you didn t know i wa really good at volleyball too the only junior who had ever been allowed to play in the senior team in history but my body wa changing i started growing breast i wa bullied all the time so i stopped playing and then it happened again the teacher asked me why i hadn t eaten in day why i smelt like i hadn t showered in day i said well dad s been on holiday for a week so i ve been taking care of myself i thought i had been doing such a great job but i would forgotten to shower sorry dad i didn t mean to get you into trouble i know you were just having a break in another city hanging out with your friend for the week this wa when cyps became involved mum wa contacted and i wa forced to move back in with mum i didn t want to go back i loved being and able to be responsible for myself setting my own rule but because i d also got into the wrong crowd and started drinking and smoking weed now too cyps thought it would be better for me to go back to mum i didn t really spend much time with her le than a year i don t know what it wa for some reason we just couldn t get along mum and i fought so often but i never knew why again you told me you were sick of me mum so i left again to dad this time cyps would be waiting for me when i stepped off the plane they sat me down and talked to me about how they would be there for me and they were finally someone i could call when i needed help but i never really needed help because i knew how to look after myself at i would get a boyfriend he would help me with so much his dad wa really nice too he would buy our alcohol and smoke for u and sometimes we would steal his weed when i wa we got into a fight because he told me some other girl wa trying to kiss him so i went to her house with the intention of only talking to her but she made me so mad i ended up hitting her a few time later that day the police turned up to my house they knew it wa me because the ring i wa wearing had imprinted on her face cyps came again they wanted me to go back to mum it wasn t safe for me to live with dad they became aware of my drug an alcohol use not that that made any difference when i moved back with mum she would rather we do that at home then with some stranger which is great because that would mean that nothing bad would happen to u i m so glad that even though i did not stay in school i didn t get pregnant like the rest of my highschool friend at least you were proud of me for that mum but when you began treating my best friend like more of a daughter than me when you guy would plan on going out for breakfast or lunch and not tell me just leave in the car while i wa lying on my bed that hurt when i confronted mum about it she told me i wa being stupid my little sister even said that my best friend wa a better sister that i ever wa that hurt i packed my thing knowing that i wasn t wanted and moved to the big city a few hour away to start my life on my own i had already looked after myself most of my life i knew i would be able to cope alone and i did i found a full time job at studied at and just lived my life i loved what i wa doing being myself making a life of my own now at i have been trying to figure or why for most of my life my anxiety ha come from it wasn t until i wa when it all started when i wa told that i wa not accepted into my dream job because the guy who wa hiring me wa intimidated by me i wa the only other person who could do his job in the city we lived in he told a few people that the opposition company i had worked for previously said bad thing about me noone knew why he would say such thing considering it wa that company that told me i didn t fit into their brand and to try to with another department i tried that one but again i didn t fit their brand either i really wa beginning to feel like i really didn t fit in it hasn t been until recently that what people say ha started to affect me because i know that people can be hurtful and i know that i am better than that but in my current job my anxiety ha worsened i still do not know where it come from when ever i have an argument with my bos he doesn t care for my reasoning which make thing hard because i get into trouble for thing and don t get to give an explanation a to why i get scoffed at when i am unwell and have to call my bos and tell them that i wo not be into work i hear that the operation manager ha been talking about me in a negative way and won t talk to my face about what he s been thinking when i try to explain thing my reason are not being taken into account my recent medical diagnosis is not being taken into account and i am going through disciplinary process to rectify my illness and it symptom it is been hard to make them understand me understand why i have panic attack understand why i might look normal while i have one understand why i have developed agoraphobia when all i ve ever wanted in my life is to be accepted understood listened to and cared for sometimes all you want is to connect with someone on that level it didn t help when i wa and went to the doctor to tell them i felt depressed and he asked me do you go to school do you work do you work out my answer to all of those question wa no he said to me well you might a well just go and kill yourself you don t do anythign with your life i walked out of the office more upset that i wa when i walked in that appointment wa the reason why i didn t want to talk to my doctor anymore i didn t trust that what i said wa really being taken seriously by anyone that ha ever spoken to me about thing that are to do with my mental health i just want to be normal again i just want to be myself again but now i have this fear of doing anything where anyone on the outside might see me judge me for a decision i have made something i have said how i look the result of something i ve done i wonder if people really do think that i m good enough but like i said nothing bad ha ever happened to me so it s probably all in my head right,anxiety
-12.254772,-0.71352446,do i have an anxiety disorder or am i just shy i have suffered anxiety for a long a i can remember my kindergarten teacher recommended my parent have me assessed because i wa overly shy they never did and my first year of primary school were filled with dread and terrible anxiety it is never been extremely crippling it never prevented me from making friend but it ha hindered me socially throughout my school year i dreaded interaction with others and missed most school camp because of it now and my symptom seem to be getting worse i can be sitting at a bbq with friend i have known for year and be trembling in my head i desire relationship with people certainly with woman but when opportunity present themselves to do so i do whatever i can to prevent further social contact because i dread having to do anything that involves leaving my house unless i have to i can socialize but it take a lot of effort and worrying to do so now it is getting to the point where i avoid family gathering or even striking up conversation with my parent i just want to be isolated most of the time thing i usually get great enjoyment from i am now generally apathetic towards and i am tired a lot of the time the only place none of this really applies is work funnily enough i am actually somewhat confident at work but i think that is due to my position and the fact that i almost become a different person at work in saying that i have had a couple of minor panic attack at work in the past two month if any of my work mate suddenly showed up at my house i would probably just shut down socially and freak out aside from this i generally feel hopeless see little meaning in actually doing anything a i feel like i am gaining nothing from life despite all the effort i put in i am seeing a doctor on thursday hopefully i can figure out what is causing all of this i question whether anything is actually wrong with me because people with anxiety disorder generally have much worse symptom than i do i feel bad because i want there to be something wrong with me so i can start to understand it sorry for the long post,anxiety
73.93891,-15.364712,my experience flying alone for the first time this may be a long read but since so many people were supportive about my last two post on this subject i thought i d share my experience and the valuable lesson i learned and hopefully reassure people who are flying alone for the first time honestly it s not a bad a it seems exhausting and chaotic sure but it s nothing to freak out about if you miss your flight because you got lost or because you didn t realize that your flight information had changed it s no big deal the staff will put you on the next available flight it s happened to my parent dozen of time tsa isn t so bad either it s okay no one is going to grab your stuff and run off with it while you re being searched i promise you re not going to lose anything cause some jackass ran off with it and no they won t ask if you re hiding any bomb i promise and once you get on the plane you ve successfully made it one step closer to your destination that being said i think a few tip for the people who are first time flyer or first time flyer alone would come in handy considering i learned a few valuable thing yesterday checkin isn t complicated if you get your ticket online they ll scan them ask if you want your bag checked hand you your boarding pas and you re free to go tsa is there to help you they re not big and bad unless you violate airport guideline or break the law some might pat you down if they see something that show up on their screen but usually it s nothing bad i once wa stopped because i had silver thread in my sweater another time i got stopped for forgetting to take my chapstick out of my pocket but if you have a question or if you feel nervous feel free to tell tsa about any question concern you have and oftentimes they ll point you in the right direction finding your gate is not that hard just keep in mind that your gate can change at any moment due to circumstance regarding your flight just make sure you know where your flight is and read the sign you have plenty of time before the plane actually board get some food use the restroom they won t leave while you re using the restroom or getting some good old airport burger king depending on what group you re in it may take some time for you to actually get on the plane so don t stress you won t miss your flight while you re away from your gate pay attention to what your pilot flight attendant and gate agent have to say all of it is important and the reason they tell you is because you cannot rely on your original flight information gate can change at any moment flight could get delayed canceled or switched to a different time so pay attention when your pilot talk over the plane s intercom and listen for your flight information when you re in the airport and a always read the sign if they have to check one of your carry on bag it s no big deal make sure there s no valuable in it and you ll see it when you land if your luggage doe not arrive when you do don t panic you will get your luggage sometimes they may have to ship it to you but it doesn t take long at all depending on where you live once you finally get on the plane to your destination you re almost in the clear when you land you can get your luggage find your ride and be on your merry way see not so hard don t let your anxiety complicate something so simple and remember the staff are there to help,anxiety

17.109325,25.661247,how i lived with and beat anxiety from to year old hello reddit i am an year old guy that had rather severe health anxiety so severe that i spent practically every night in the toilet with vomiting diarrhea uncontrollable shaking and abdominal cramp that would make me turn red and feel dizzy it started in and by i had mostly dealt with it wa a good year but i still had some trouble now in i am confident in saying that i know all of anxiety is trick and how to avoid them i have a girlfriend working on business enjoying a mostly stress free life and ignoring society is label since i like impacting other people is life in a positive way i will share these with you set goal yes goal i have seen it over and over again a lot of people with anxiety are people who are bored out of their mind procrastinating at home all day turning down social event that doe more harm than good your comfort zone is actually your anxiety zone allowing their mind to wander to bad place hey if i am stuck at home for day watching tv series or youtube video i am sure to end up with negative thought and a tense feeling so set goal and more importantly work on them finish up that book you have been writing set up the business you have always wanted fix your car just engage yourself in something and you will find that you wo not have time for anxiety this tip is fairly limited to health anxiety only but it is the hypochrondriac miracle basically do not start worrying about a problem unless it is been prevalent for a couple of day or gotten worse with time even a lot of serious health condition will not kill you or do long term damage to this quickly of course there are exception but you should not jump the gun every time you get a calf cramp dvt or get heartburn sternum pain heart attack calm down go on with your day or night and seek help only if it last more than a couple of day or is obviously worsening this tip is for people who get evening or night anxiety i am certain that it is due to a stressful recurring event in your every day life a a person with a competitive nature i spent hour at a time in front of my computer the last few year climbing the ladder to the top rank of the most popular computer game today believe it or not while playing a match in these game min to an hour my system would remain in a constant fight or flight mode without me realizing i would play match every day which lead to me being tense a hell come evening or night eventually leading to a panic attack later on the same can be applied for work sport and more a tether note this is only a short term solution a tether is something you hold on to right well that is exactly what i would do bring my phone out of my pocket while my intestine are attempting to spontaneously combust in the toilet and play a game or read anxiety forum just do not do the latter it doe not work what i found out that really helped wa talking to people in real time sitting in the toilet late at night shaking and fearing for my life while everyone else is sleeping wa a scary experience however once i discovered that i can hit up my friend on messenger or call my grandmother i would get instant relief i wa a honest a possible with them too me hey man why are you up so late them ca not sleep playing a game drinking whatever me well i am shitting my brain out and feel like something bad is about to happen ha this ever happened to you them yeah man i know that feeling it happens to me too sometimes the above dialogue is not made up and most of the people i have connected with on this topic have all managed to relate what doe this mean it mean that pretty much everyone struggle with anxiety but the majority do not acknowledge it and boil it down to other reason and forget about it the fact that they forget about it make them le likely to have frequent episode while the anxiety sufferer expects their panic attack all the time worrying whether it will happen while

m not sure what exactly i m looking to get out of this some advice some feedback opinion just someone to talk to i don t know i just felt like i had to get all this off my chest it s rather long i apologize for that but if you take the time to read it thank you even if you just skim it or whatever thank you let is just say i have some issue with anxiety every day all day i am at least somewhat anxious even when i am at home and everything seems good and nothing is directly triggering my anxiety i am stressing a little bit in the back of my mind my subconscious or whatever i am stressing about something on a scale of being normal or what i assume would be normal for most people and full blown panic attack i am always at least at a or at my best of time i always feel uncomfortable i think the correct term is malaise just feeling really uncomfortable and uneasy all the time i ca not stop it right now a i type this up i am at about a thinking about my anxiety actually make me a little anxious when my anxiety hit about on the scale i start zone i start blocking out external stimulus and just focus on the anxiety and whatever triggered it this can get really dangerous i ve actually almost been hit by a car when this happened now there are several thing that can trigger my anxiety i even stress about the current stress i am having and will have in the future it s exhausting the big trigger the one that i have had the longest and cause some of the most intense panic attack i have had present itself usually when i am at home i live with my dad and two brother if one of my family member is running late even by a few minute and i ca not get a hold of them i freak out i just lock up completely it s like my mind is gear just grind to a halt i ca not focus on anything at all i would say that is an on the scale creeping up to if i can somehow break out of that i go into full on panic mode pacing pure dread checking the clock checking the door checking the phone if it is been more than a half an hour then i am convinced they are dead somewhere the wave of relief that wash over me when i hear them pull up is huge i will admit i have actually cried tear of joy when they got home on some of the worst night i know it is irrational i do even when it is happening i know it is irrational but it doe not help whatsoever sometimes they do not even have to be running late for me to worry even now a i type this it is in the evening and my brother and his girlfriend just left my heart just jumped and i have a cold sweat breaking out i am already worrying about them and they are not even out of the neighborhood yet how ridiculous is that i feel so bad because if i start to worry too much probably around a or i will have no choice but to call them to make sure they are okay keep in mind i have absolutely no logical reason to think anything is wrong but there i would be anyway bothering them because of my problem the only thing that seems to remedy this is to just not live with them i used to worry almost exclusively about my sister when she lived at home when she got engaged and moved out i stopped worrying about her out of sight out of mind i guess unfortunately i then started worrying about my brother and later my dad it is like my brain ha to have someone to freak out about i feel like i am freaking cursed sometimes the obvious remedy is to move get away from the people that trigger my anxiety i do not want to have to i enjoy living with my family i love my family unfortunately because of my other issue i do not really have much of an option anyway another big trigger is social interaction with stranger especially if it is something important job interview are the big one when i can get them you see i have a very spotty work history i am and i have only ever had three real job in my life one at another at and the third last year none of them ever lasted more than four month all three of them required no real interview two of them were temp job you know how when most people get an interview they celebrate they get excited that is not me i get nauseous no matter how much i prep no matter how confident i am at my ability to do the job itself that all go out the window the second i shake that interviewer is hand i become a sputtering sweating mess that ca not even remember his own limited work history at worst i will start to zone end up like a deer caught in headlight and then that is it interview over a big part of it is that i ca not do small talk not well at least and really that is what an interview is a a matter of fact i had an interview at family video last year and wa actually told by the guy that i wa too socially awkward to work there thanks for not sugar coating it i guess i mean how do you explain multiple year gap in your work history without looking like a weirdo anyway my option for a job are also limited because i do not drive i do not drive because when i get behind the wheel i have a panic attack full blown on the scale i completely lock up and get faint the idea that i am in control of a multi ton weapon that can kill people if i make a slight mistake just no i do not even want to think about it it is something i feel crushing guilt over though because i should be driving i should not be burdening my family member for ride when i need to go somewhere i feel like they resent me for it and honestly i do not blame them if so it is not fair to them if i drove maybe my life would be totally different i would certainly have more job option or more likely more interview to either bomb or blow off because i am scared when i do have a job my anxiety is elevated while working always i would put it at a solid while just doing standard day to day work constantly worrying at all time if the pressure is on to go faster work harder it get worse at that point i start to zone which make my job performance suffer which in turn make me freak out more and the cycle continues if i am being scrutinized by management at any point my anxiety jump to an or after getting yelled at for messing something up at my last job i had to go to the bathroom and calm down because i remember getting light headed and numb i pretty much could not do work for the rest of the day this anxiety lead to me calling off work a lot it is the main reason i got let go from all three job though my performance sucked a well i am sure if i have a particularly bad day at work i will usually call off the next day some day i just ca not go it is hard to explain but on those day the thought of going to work fill me with dread and that is not an exaggeration the flipside to this is that i then feel that crushing guilt because i know i should be going i feel like everyone i know will judge me that i am a lazy asshole that just want to stay at home and play video game all day you know what i tend to do on those day sleep because at least i m not worrying when it come to people until i get to know someone really know someone i am always guarded i am always looking for an exit strategy during any social interaction i try my hardest to put on a show make it look like i am just another dude but i know most of the time they can see right through it this tends to put them off which put me off and i pretty much shut them out i feel like the only friend i have had since becoming an adult are the one i wa able to trick the one that did not see the awkward bumbling and frankly scared me on the inside i know a lot of people don t like small talk but i actually fear it i can typically bumble my way through it if it is short but that awkward silence when the small talk peter out oh my god that scare me so much i will avoid any scenario where i have to engage in small talk if i can for example i will go to wal mart instead of target simply because they have self checkout even though i vastly prefer target otherwise that horrible small talk at work is the worst though because you ca not escape it despite all that i worry what people think of me every single person it is not that i want people to like me so much i just worry that i am making a fool of myself at all time and that people think i am an idiot i do not know why i worry about it so much i even worry about it with stranger like if i say something stupid to a cashier in my ultra nervous small talk mode i will stew over it all day i will beat myself up about all day it is generally all i can think about this actually go for anything i do it doe not matter how big or small the mistake is i just keep reliving it in my head over and over and it is infinitely worse if someone else is watching when it happens i just can t let it go so yeah i go long long period without working it must look like i have it made to a lot of people i get to sit around do nothing all day and let my dad pay for everything the truth of it is that i hate it i hate that i burden my father because of this stupid mental crap i want to want to work or at least have the capacity to tolerate it i know most people hate working i doubt most people hate working like i hate working for example i do not know anyone else who ha thrown up before going to work just because the bos might be there today i thank god that i have an amazing dad that ha not kicked me out on the street at the same time i feel i would deserve it maybe if i had to pick myself up by my bootstrap i would get over this whole thing and become a normal member of society i know that is a dumb thought but i ca not help but think it my brain suck i know that i feel like all this is getting worse a i near and i see my peer with career and family i just withdraw even more i ca not help it i honestly feel like i could be become a hermit in the wood if i let myself live at least mostly off the grid and just survive just so i do not have worry about other people or deal with anything but myself i think i would be pretty content actually god that sound so selfish but i do not mean it to be i know i am not supposed to feel that way i am trying to get the ball rolling on getting help but it is so hard i am typing this out now but i am not sure i

-11.814463,23.016459,i need to share this because i feel that you will all understand on july nd i left my long time so the main factor or rather the straw that broke the camel is back wa the fact he did not understand my anxiety and would worsen it with thinhs like his idea that holding me down during panic attack wa brilliant i told him time and time again that it would only make thing worse but he refused to listen he had been doing this for about month but it got to a point where he wa causing them out of nowhere i started medication month ago and had not had an attack aside from when being held down in week but that night he insisted i be held down i immediately went into full panic and tried pulling myself out of it but he would not let go and he kept yelling and pulling harder i wa struggling a he progressed thing which only made me pull harder he slammed my head into the ground and held me down until my arm were covered in bruise my eye were black and my forehead had a huge goose egg to go with my bruised arm he spent year convincing me i wa broken that he wa helping me by doing the thing he did he convinced me that my anxiety made me crazy that he did not have to answer to me about anything if he disappeared for hour longer than he said i wa insane for checking up on him i wa so convinced i wa in the wrong that he really did have my interest in mind and i wa too far for help since leaving him i have never felt better i realized just how much anxiety he caused and that anxiety doe not mean i am crazy it mean i care more i am more cautious that i think before i act it mean i will listen to you and validate your feeling although i am anxious about all of the court thing and feeling like he is going to come for me or that my career will be ruined before it even begin i am able to recognize that they may not happen instead of being bombarded and told i am insane i have someone who listens to my thought and talk me through them instead of calling me stupid it is so freeing to be anxious because i do not feel like i have to hide it until i explode edit thank you all for the kind word of support it is been a rough time but i feel so much happier in general i reconnected with a guy friend of mine m and we have begun a semi relationship he is much more understanding and try to help me cope with my anxiety instead of ignore it he find my neurotic habit endearing and he is been around to listen to my stress with this situation i showed up at court today only to find my request for a deferred prosecution wa granted with this he will be unable to contact me or get in any legal trouble for a year if he get so much a a speeding ticket he will be back to court for this essentially i just wanted to let this die for now i have my junior year of college coming up not to mention many other stressor and truthfully i just want to move on with my life i am ready to progress my relationship with m to make new friend and to live my life for myself i will likely be posting more a i would like to speak to others about my anxiety when i have a much better hold on it lately i have been able to see the build up and slow it down a opposed to being pushed into an attack so i will likely chronicle it thanks again all,anxiety

-8.386486,36.941418,idea and possible mini project idea now first of all this is pretty speculative and i am really not sure whether it would have much of an effect if any but it seems to me that it could have potential to work so a little back story i have pretty bad anxiety which varies in intensity and can be triggered by a variety of thing mostly people and in particular feeling like i am under scrutiny when i feel like i am being watched i can become massively self conscious and lose the ability to function smoothly in pretty much whatever i am doing this is obviously a bit of a shitter and i would quite like to do something about it i wa reading up on exposure therapy and thinking about a way that you could expose yourself to anxiety inducing stimulus in a comfortable manner hardly uncommonly i tend to spend the majority of my day sitting in front of one screen or another so i wa thinking about how one could use that a a passive exposure tool to cure your anxiety while you work i thought about those little flash animation where eye follow your mouse cursor around and wa wondering how feasible it would be to supe up a version of that to give you the feeling of being watched so my idea is for a small program that sits above all of the program on your desktop and take the form of a small pair of realistic ish looking eye or maybe a whole face that interacts with what you are doing on the screen most obviously your mouse but also ha a number of more random behaviour such a looking directly out of the screen at you or in the direction of your keyboard consciously of course you are not going to think that you are actually being scrutinised by your computer but a all anxiety sufferer know your subconscious is pretty fucking stupid and it may just be enough to start triggering the same sort of anxiety that you may feel when under genuine scrutiny with the way that exposure therapy work a i understand it retraining your amygdala by reassociating triggering stimulus with a calm mindset constant low level exposure in a calm and safe environment could potentially erode the fear response to the point that you are able to function through it this sort of approach if effective at all could also be used for a range of phobia obviously limited to something you could represent on your screen for example a little animated spider that sat in the corner of your screen occasionally moving slightly to give the impression of life i have had a bit of an investigate and found a fair bit on vr exposure therapy apparently quite effective for agoraphobia fear of flying and driving and some other computer based therapy which seemed to be based around watching video but have not found anything that seems to really work by gradual passive screen based exposure anyone think that this ha the potential to be at all effective and be willing to help me put something together i could create the various graphical element you would need for this but i would have no idea a to how to actually put together the application but i do not suppose it would be massively difficult to do i downloaded vista eye which is a basic freeware version of the googly cursor watching eye and even they seemed to trigger a kind of low level response although i have no idea whether it wa a placebo tl dr help me build an app to cure the woe of the anxious mass,anxiety

49.08225,16.093842,if you re going through a break up this might not be the right sub for this but i ve been on and off of this subreddit for a while for multiple reason and i just thought this may help somebody going through a breakup that s fuelling their depression the situation here may vary but here s my two cent heartbreak is a master manipulator don t give in to it temptation don t check their social medium s to see if they re talking to other people don t keep texting them stop looking at old photo focus on getting yourself out of this fucking horrible rut right now it s about you and only you the harsh truth is this if somebody ha broken your heart then they never fully valued your companionship in the first place if someone truly loved you then they would never ever want to break your heart they would always go out of their way to avoid making you feel like complete shit sometimes thing fall apart for something even more beautiful to take it place don t sit and stew in the memory you had with that partner and the fear that someone else will take your place you are fucking incredible and beautiful there is someone else out there with all of their good quality and more with le of the bad quality it s easier said than done of course but know that the le you flirt with the memory and the thought of them the faster you will heal trust me i am going through this exact situation right now and i m even falling guilty against my own advice here from time to time you can do it it may be over between you and them but it isn t over for you it may even be for the best our mind like to fabricate this perfect future but the chance are slim unless you are both committed and can prove it action in love is so much more powerful than colourful language remember that if they give you hope for a second chance take it with a pinch of salt don t completely fall for that possible ruse but don t completely disregard it either just focus on yourself and see what happens just keep in mind that if you do get back together they will not change nobody is going to change their entire chemistry and personality just for you i could go on forever but just remember to keep yourself busy don t ob over them surround yourself with good people if you can i love you you got this kick as and heal you fucking got this,depression

-5.878972,16.28365,ca not identify what problem of mine hold me back anymore i wa not sure where to post this probably could of picked half a dozen subreddits but i picked this because depression seems the most normal thing to me throwaway account and i am pretty sure i wo not be able to tl dr any of this where to begin yo male it harder and harder to keep thinking that number keep getting higher and it all get worse it feel like i have not started living yet but i have lived a hard life i know there wa a point where i did not believe there wa a problem maybe till about or but i ca not remember what that ever felt like some people say self diagnosing is bad and shun you for doing such well they are not doctor ether other than depression i know i suffer from anxiety problem both social and the kind where you go into thought loop that you cant get out of maybe i am bi polar because i feel like i get happy moment for no explainable reason which cause me to fall down into bad mood i do not always feel apathetic and lethargic like some people with depression but i seem to crash and burn off of my high i feel convinced that good feeling are delusion the more i try to stay in the moment the harder and more disillusioned i get when i crash i also am a bulemic i do not suffer so bad from purging episode a i did year ago but it been going back to the bad side a of late i know i had a good month where i just stopped and i cant figure out how or why i also believe i am an alcoholic i have done numerous other drug in my time but none a pervasive of a compulsion to me is alcohol even smoking last year i smoked half a pack a day quit cold turkey for month went back and i have gotten to the point where i smoke a pack in a week and i have not had one in two day because i ca not afford them and that doe not really bother me like i see it bother others who try to quit alcohol is the bane of my existence at this moment father wa an alcoholic and society in general seems to make it that everyone drink good thing i have not had a drink in day except not drinking doe not seem to alleviate much in my mind after not drinking for or day straight it feel good to stop i start to get a better outlook on thing i start to gain some confidence that i can make it work this time but then i hit a mental wall all that energy i have disappears the good feeling i could have with a drink or two dont ever seem to come in a natural state the confidence i may of had in making a decision or attempting to socialize go away without it and i feel a if my bulimic tendency get amplified without alcohol thing should be getting better for me without drinking but they never seem to i went day over the course of last summer without drinking i know i wanted it then a much a i wanted it now to get better but it never did i wa just sober when i drank again i wa right back in it drunk me doe not care what sober me want to try to accomplish someone may recommend that i try to exercise way ahead of you started when i wa when i started to realize what depression wa an i wa slipping into it i know people say exercise help i wa overweight and out of shape i did something about it now the one thing in life i can do is get myself to goto the gym doe not matter how shit i feel or hungover i am i walk in and got somewhat of a plan also how the bulemia started i wa trying so hard to loose weight i could not allow myself to be anything other than perfect i kept saying i cant go back despite the fact at the time i wa not very smart with the whole eating and marcos and all of that certian food were verboten i had never thought much about eating disorder except i knew what they were until the day i started it wa like a rubber band snapped in my head i ate something i should not have it made me feel not good a few slice of cake where i had not consumed that much sugar in month made me feel on pin and needle and i had to get rid of it i had done something bad there wa no going back i have gotten better a i said it not a bad a it wa but if i feel bloated like i ate too fast or ate too much or me craving somthing sweet those are trigger i do not push myself a hard a i did back when i wa full blown bulemic and trying to loose weight but i still see myself a fat a bit of a belly that doe not bother me a much but i beat myself up alot it doe not feel satisfying most day to goto the gym but i feel worse if i do not go it doe not matter what i do it just doe not feel that it wa good enough i lost my girlfriend of a year my first and only one a few week ago it wa a destructive relationship i am not really sad to see it break up and she wa a islore for a woman anyways i mean i feel bad that i could not get myself in a better place for her i wa open and honest with her but i do not believe she cared about me a much a she did to need someone around she got a new boyfriend a day after i had broken off a conversation with her from some unrelated reason and she claim that she had moved on for month while we were acting the same to eachother a we had a i said she is a islore just suck because that wa my one line of any kind of friendship i had the difference between me and her is that i can and have been honest about my problem with the few people in life that i know i know i need help and i ca not do it alone she doe not want help and ha been adamate about it to me despite knowing she is bi polar herself despite that i think on the surface thing could be looking up for me i may be starting a new job soon i am and have been unemployed for the past month i am about to run out of money and that is always a source of worry for me but i may be a functioning member of society again where i will be able to have health insurance once again thats where the social anxiety problem come in i had health insurance last year for a time i never used it to find help i do not know who to call or where to go i am even more afraid of how much it will cost especially right now without insurance nothing in life come for free good thing cost more and i hate the idea of debt i have no credit card i pay my cell phone and insurance and rent in full with cash when due paid for my car in cash owing someone a dime may be my worst fear and i fear that i ca not pay it back going to a doctor doe not have a cost listed like a menu board like mcdonalds if i know what something cost i can ass what it worth to me and if i want it and afford it then i pay for it but even if there wa a number to call which would give me the answer i need to hear i would not know what it wa i hate phone if it wa for business and i knew what the topic of conversation wa going to be i would do fine but if it calling up a friend or family because i want to talk or in this case find help i do not have it in me i have some kind of underlying fear of rejection id rather be sad and cry it away i know thats not going to work anymore but that doe not just fix anything i do not have anyone in my life other than my dad who is an alcoholic and addicted to painkiller he doe not really drink anymore and his painkiller use is due to hip and back problem surgery and i know he doe not overdo it but i can tell when he loaded i do not like to talk with him though because he go on tangent and i ca not ever get the answer i want out of him i had a troubled childhood with him and my sister and her husband i have laid my heart out for them told them everything about me that i could get out because i have gone long period of time without talking to ether of them because i ca not just pick up a phone i have told them about what hangups i have had with them i held alot of anger in my heart for many year but i feel a if i wa able to let that go didnt help me at all they seem supportive and willing to help and in some way they have but i do not need money or possession or someone to talk to a much a i need to find a doctor i guess face to face i do not seem so broken a that it really that desperate it been desperate for year i try to tell them and my ex i thought being honest wa the best thing i could be but it doe not help me it feel like everytime i tell someone the problem i suffer in silent from it a weight off my shoulder it feel like a high all high wear off then i am right back to where i wa like why did i bother i thought they could help me nope it feel like i am always on the edge of oblivion like it could be minute away weather it be taking a drink or trying to kill myself or running out of money i mean i have never tried to commit suicide but i tell myself if i had an idea that this would never end i would do it without hesitation but it the not knowing that keep me alive thought of suicide are not so in my face when i do not drink but it doe not seem any le of a crazy idea a i said it feel like i have not started to actually live yet like i know life is out there and i see people doing it everyday and i want that and thats what i hold out for but at somepoint we all die i hope someone read this but it probably look like an a d d mess i think i may sufffer from that but it really just a lack of overall motivation i can motivate myself everyday to goto the gym but i ca not study for a test i will be taking over the weekend i do not read more than website anymore and reddit is one of them i have probably tab open right now which i will never finish reading it a mirricle that i sat down for the hour to type this out i know something got left out but i doubt anyone else will spend the time to read it and care of anything

15.768018,28.740202,my depressed wife is leaving me and not depressed for a guy with depression and she wo not seek treatment my wife of year who i have been with for ha a history of untreated depression that wa all she ever really told me about it until later this year when it wa already too late everything wa great for the first year she had bad day sometimes but nothing frequent she started a new job a few month before our wedding that turned out to be extremely toxic the job reinforced bad feeling she had about herself she always blamed her bad mood on the job and made excuse for them that i believed she lost this job a few month after we got married at which point she started displaying severe symptom of depression in hindsight it is so obvious that i should have done something but i thought that she would be ok when she found a new job she still did not talk to me about her depression and i still do not know what i would have done if i had known force her to go to therapy from what i know now that is not really possible or healthy we drank socially and did drug occasionally but she started drinking alone more and doing harder drug socially without me she started smoking weed alone daily something i told her i did not like again i stupidly thought it wa a phase and would end in time her excuse wa that she wa not doing these thing alone she wa drinking and smoking weed while chatting with her online friend while i wa at work month ago about year after our wedding she told me she wa not in love with me anymore after some questioning she admitted that she had feeling for one of her online friend who also suffers from depression she helped him through a recent breakup and she said he understood her depression in a way that i never did which is partly because she never talked to me about it i told her that i wanted her to go to therapy alone and we could go to couple therapy for u to work on our marriage and find out how i can help with her depression i made her promise to cut contact with this guy during this time a month later i found evidence that she never cut communication with him at all which she confirmed upset i told her to move out and figure out what she wanted while she continued her therapy i found out later that she only went to session in total all with a psychologist that she did not really like she moved home to live with her parent again i thought she wa going to therapy at home but she wa not i believe she depended on the other guy for therapy and support during this time last week after month apart and not speaking she contacted me to tell me that she still think we are wrong for each other and that we should get a divorce i do not think i am being spineless if my wife wa not depressed i would have left her month ago due to her infidelity and unwillingness to work on our marriage but because of her depression i am not able to believe that it is really what she want and i just ca not give up on her yet i have been seeing a therapist to help myself deal with this situation and to find out how i can help her he belief that her depression is driving her destructive choice and this guy is taking advantage of her and manipulating her in a time of weakness she doe not talk to her friend about any of this at all i have been in touch with her best friend and they told me that they think she is making terrible choice and they want her to patch thing up with me and get help i spoke to her a few day ago and she claim she is doing better exercising starting new hobby and new job but is still not getting treatment for her depression and still think we should divorce but ha taken no action to do so yet she agreed to meet with me in week to talk i feel like it is my last desperate chance to save my marriage but more realistically it is probably my chance for closure because i will not be able to change her mind hearing her tell me it is over is like hearing a stranger tell me that my wife want to divorce me i just ca not believe it unless it come from her and i feel like she is not herself anymore due to her depression i know it would be so much easier on me to just give up and let her go but after all she is done and all this time i still love her and me her family and her friend all believe that she is making the wrong choice for u and for her own mental health using this new guy a a crutch is dangerous and what happens when they are both depressed at the same time i am terrified to think about what she might do when her new relationship crash down a it is sure to do tl dr and my question for r depression is when i talk to my depressed and estranged wife in week what is the best way for me to encourage her to go to therapy and get help besides the fact that it is the best thing for her health i also feel like if she doe this and learns how to deal with her depression better and still want to leave me i would be able to better accept her decision,depression

22.424425,18.724398,year hello everyone after giving it much thought i thought i would write up my story on this subreddit since i recall reading very useful information on here so i want to give back please read the entire thing and i apologize for the poor writing english is not my native language i am trying my best early childhood ever since i wa about year old i remember getting these very brief period of dp these usually lasted for about second and it would come in very randomly these are hard to explain they would happen at any moment in the day at school in the shower while eating dinner etc very random my vision would go blurry a bit and i would get thought like am i real am i really here this would last for a few second and i would somehow snap back into reality i never gave much thought to these since it wa very random and not frequent maybe once every or so month year old fast forward to year old i still remember the very day in early february i wa at a huge party at a friend is house one of my first experience with alcool and weed i got somewhat drunk perhaps or drink during the night that is when i went outside on the balcony there wa a few guy there smoking pot i had only tried weed a couple of time before but never mixed with booze i decided to give it a try took a single bong hit it wa strong weed and a soon a i exhaled that smoke i felt a massive headrush i wa heavily stoned and drunk that is when the paranoia and anxiety hit me i had never been this fucked up before i thought i had just fried my brain i thought i would never be sober again that maybe i had triggered something permanently in my head now of course this wa all parano a and i wa eventually gonna come down but in the moment i had extreme anxiety the following hour were hell thinking back now i simply believe i had a panic attack while being high and drunk i kept walking around telling everyone how bad i felt and they were trying to calm me down saying i wa simply very high and all i had to do wa relax i tried relaxing but my mind wa racing with very destructive thought i wa convinced i wa never gonna come down from this high i eventually threw up and someone took me home the ride home is unclear in my memory but i remember feeling very bad when i got home i threw up again drank some water and fell asleep i woke up maybe hour later i wa still in this state of extreme parano a the same state i wa the night before now that is where i started to really panic i wa now convinced i would never be sober or normal again and i also had a lot of thought like is this real am i real i began trying to analyze my condition i noticed i felt like i wa watching my life in rd person a if i wa watching a bad horror movie or something this wa extremely frightening i started looking online for thing like never ending marijuana high for the following day i never felt any better than i did on that night i spent my whole day analyzing myself my state of mind and trying to find answer online i wa utterly scared of telling my parent since marijuana wa very badly perceived back then one day after hour of online search i found someone mentioning dpdr i googled it and after reading the first few symptom i recognized myself in all of these i started reading story online on here on other forum and i realized i had the same thing these people had i thought this wa comforting that i wa not the only one out there the road to recovery after reading countless story medical report and others i came down to the conclusion that my anxiety wa causing this some online claimed that this condition wa not harmful to my physical being but it wa self feeding itself with my anxiety i realized it wa a vicious cycle the dpdr wa producing anxiety and that anxiety wa feeding the dpdr whether or not this wa true this is what gave me hope since i knew that anxiety could be dealt with this is where i started to work on myself i started working out to improve my self esteem and the hormonal effect of being physically active helped i recall once seeing a physician and got some benzos for anxiety but i never really used them i did not like the side effect at all i decided i wa gonna defeat this by my own mean i read lot of book on human condition philosophy etc these book gave me a better perspective on life i went from thinking about dpdr every second of my life to only thinking about it every hour then every hour then twice a day then once a day and so on after about a year i wa rarely thinking about it but it wa somehow still there it kind of became a part of me i think i eventually embraced it this might seem frightening at first that such a horrible feeling would be a part of who you are but a time go you come to accept it reflecting on this i wish i had seeked help back then maybe something could have helped me in a much quicker manner today almost year since that event took placed i can tell with confidence that it is gone this is not a recent thing i have felt improvement gradually over the year year seems like a long time but for my personal case after about a year and a half i wa almost back to being myself except for the occasional intrusive thought now maybe you are experiencing something similar to what i experienced year ago if this is the case i know it can seem scary right now but just know that this wo not kill you and it will get better i think consulting a mental health professionnal is one of the best thing you can do keep in mind that if you can get rid of the anxiety you will either not feel it at all or you will reach a point where it not noticeable on a daily basis add activity and people that will be beneficial for your anxiety like sport reading walking outside etc stay sober you wanna stay connected with reality drug were never helpful in my experience they were harmful in my recovery i never used any hard drug but i never touched cannabis again out of fear that it would retrigger it a panic attack and i am fine with that i do not need it in my life before i get any negative comment i am aware that my dpdr wa caused by a panic attack and not by weed itself i wanted to share my experience because i know that back then it would have helped me if you have any question feel free to ask them i am not a mental health professionnal in any form just trying to help people,dpdr
48.54584,16.00925,how to cure depersonalization why do you feel unreal after smoking weed i am cured hello my friend my name is ben i felt unreal for almost two month before i figured out what wa going on this is what i learned why do you feel unreal and numb after smoking weed you may have depersonalization derealization disorder ddd ddd is a mental disorder which cause you to feel unreal numb like in a dream or video game two dimensional a though you were looking through a pane of glass disconnected from your body and or dissociative i had depersonalization derealization disorder since then i have helped over a hundred different people who also had ddd thus i know how it feel what can cause it the link between weed and ddd and what can help you get out here we go x b this is an article from my blog in which i describe the link between depersonalizaton and weed why do i feel unreal and numb after smoking weed depersonalization what is depersonalization derealization disorder how do scientist categorize ddd ddd is categorized a a nonpsychotic mental disorder and a a dissociative disorder the most important and scientifically accepted classification system is the international statistical classification of disease and related health problem icd the icd classifies ddd under othernonpsychotic mental disorder scientist in the united state of america more often use the classification system called diagnostic and statistical manuel of mental disorder dsm here ddd is categorized a a dissociative disorder how do scientist describe the difference between depersonalization and derealization depersonalization is a mental disorder in which the patient feel unreal fake numb a though they lack emotion and or is disconnected from their body nevertheless the patient still pass the reality check meaning they notice that something is wrong derealization is a mental disorder in which the patient perceives his or her surroundings a unreal fake two dimensional or a in a dream nevertheless the patient still pass the reality check meaning they notice that something is wrong how do i describe ddd depersonalization a well a derealization are hell on earth a state of mind i would wish on nobody not even on my worst enemy i had ddd for over four month and for me ddd is a protective mechanism which is triggered by your mind when it feel thing are getting out of hand what do i mean by this well a soon a you exceed a certain anxiety threshold this protective mechanism namely ddd is activated it want to help you cope with everything that is increasing your anxiety consciously or unconsciously which is a little paradox at first since ddd is super scary and boost your anxiety level to begin with this paradox make ddd insanely difficult to get rid of is there a link between weed and depersonalization derealization disorder most people who smoke pot never develop ddd nevertheless a large percentage of people suffering from ddd state that it wa triggered by marijuana in a lot of case this change of state is accompanied by a panic attack in my opinion this distinction whether it wa due to weed or the panic attack is essential for your healing process why well if weed triggered it i would lean more towards toxin in the body specifically in the brain being the cause of the ddd in case of a panic attack induced ddd it seems more likely in my opinion that the cause can be found in high anxiety level due to unresolved trauma such a emotional abuse death of a loved one stress at work or even the birth of one s child there might be another reason for weed being one of the main trigger of ddd and it s called personalisation what is personalisation ddd most commonly occurs between the age of and adolescence and young adulthood during this stage of life adolescence start a path of self analysis second guessing questioning who they really are and finding their own identity this youth identity crisis is called personalisation marijuana is often used to explore one s inner world and can help find your own identity thus supporting an adolescence s path towards personalization however imagine the following scenario of an adolescent called mike who is a highly sensitive youngster searching for an identity experienced childhood trauma and is about to smoke a joint this joint may very well reveal overwhelming feeling and thought which mike is not ready for and thus instead of taking a step towards personalization he dive into a nightmare called ddd so is there a link between weed and ddd considering the high percentage of people stating that weed triggered ddd there must be nevertheless weed could very likely be nothing more than a magnifying glass giving you a closer look at your own self which in many case admittedly help you find your own identity but can also in case like mike enforce you to lose contact to reality welcoming ddd into your life what can cause depersonalization derealization disorder my observation is a soon a your anxiety level cross a certain threshold your two new best friend mr depersonalization and mr derealization appear i have dedicated countless hour to analysing the cause of ddd hereby considering not only my own experience but also the insight of all the people who have reached out to me all my experience gathered fact and hour of reflection have led me to the belief that ddd appears when your anxiety level cross a certain threshold i believe every person carry this threshold within them but most people s anxiety level never reach this critical limit nevertheless some people do and my observation is that the cause of this anxiety limit exceedance and thus of ddd can be divided up into two main category toxicity and trauma now every person is wired differently consequently trauma and toxicity will affect them differently thus everyone must use some self awareness to analyse themselves and figure out what s most likely to have caused their ddd it s not necessarily an either or question your ddd can have it origin in a combination of both thus i would try tackling anxiety due to toxicity and trauma is weed toxic x b is weed toxic and in consequence a possible cause for exceedance of the above mentioned anxiety threshold to answer this question we must understand what toxicity mean a substance toxicity level stand in correlation with the damage it doe to the consumer tetrahydrocannabinol in short thc is the principal psychoactive constituent in marijuana thc is inhaled while smoking a joint absorbed almost instantly from the lung and passed on into the bloodstream from here it is transported to the brain and slip through the blood brain barrier here it work it magic you get your high and then it disappears out of the brain again the same way it came or it diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid cf either way it leaf the brain thus thc doesn t stay in the brain or nervous system meaning weed is not toxic right not completely why because in today s society a large amount of marijuana is laced with heavy metal which heavy metal can be found in weed that can do severe damage to the consumer arsenic cadmium mercury and lead the problem with these heavy metal is that they don t leave the brain a swiftly a thc they tend to linger around and accumulate after passing the blood brain barrier heavy metal have been linked to prominent mental disorder such a dementia schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depression this lead me to believe that ddd might possibly also be negatively affected by these heavy metal if not solely then at least partially either way we want to get out of ddd and to do so anxiety level must be decreased heavy metal increase your toxicity level and toxicity level increase your anxiety consciously or subconsciously considering you want to get rid of ddd every approach which ha the potential of decreasing anxiety level is beneficial ergo get rid of those heavy metal what can cure depersonalization derealization disorder i m sure by now you are wondering what you can do to cure ddd sorry but you will not like this answer severe ddd in most case last between six to twelve month sometimes even longer the six most important pillar and the first step to recovery are understanding what you have knowing you re not alone knowing that thousand of people have gotten through ddd so you can too acceptance patience keep on going with your life now this knowledge wa great to come by and it really is the foundation of curing ddd nevertheless it didn t really feel like this knowledge wa getting me closer to my goal which wa getting rid of my ddd i wanted to get out of ddd a fast a possible and i m sure you feel the same way thus being patient and waiting six month wasn t an option a a result i tried everything i mean everything and i will give you a list of what you can do which could possibly decrease your time stuck in ddd before i do though i want to emphasize every person is different every person ha different biochemistry different past and different mental and physical health meaning which one of the following tip if any will help you i cannot say also please before you test the following suggestion go to your general practitioner and get yourself checked for any physical symptom get your blood tested and a ct so you are sure nothing physical is wrong after you have done this you can continue with my suggestion we discussed ddd being caused by toxicity trauma or a combination of both i divided the following list into a toxicity and trauma approach section i would recommend doing everything since everything on the list can decrease your anxiety level and which method work best for you only you can know so here we go toxicity visit a toxicologist try chelation therapy try these supplement enterosgel chlorella cleanse the digestive system st john s wort omega l theanine stress relief anti anxiety supplement the first three supplement suggestion had the largest impact on my ddd thus i can strongly recommend trying a supplement to cleanse the digestive system enterosgel and chlorella the other supplement were beneficial but not to the degree of the first three trauma

20.269539,23.701044,just a heroin story alright so i lurk this sub all the time occasionally commenting once in a while well i got some very discouraging news yesterday so i am just going to tell me story involving opiate like a lot of people the story about my heroin usage doe not actually begin with heroin but with pill now i had done pill before off and on for a couple year after a car wreck and i first got prescribed a decent amount i had mg vicodines about of them and i ate a few at a time to test the water after that i consider myself hooked i blew through that script in about a week and once it wa gone i wa out hunting for more i never had a steady supply or hookup so i never got sick or anything when i ran out i had a friend who i will refer to a jeremy jeremy introduced me to all sort of different drug and our favorite thing wa psycahdelics this wa all fine and dandy for about a year until one day i let him borrow my motorcycle he had just left work on my bike and me in his car we were really close so doing something like this did not seem like a bad idea obviously i wa completely wrong about that a i am driving home i get a call from his wife about minute after i saw him and she is screaming at me and freaking out i told you not to let him borrow your bike how fucking stupid can you be screaming shit like that over and over c you need to shut the fuck up and tell me what happened instead of yelling after a minute or so of calming her down she tell me jeremy ha wrecked my bike and is really hurt and they are on their way to the hospital this wa my best friend so i immediately do a u turn and head to the hospital i get there about a minute after they did and their is blood all over their car not a little blood but a huge amount more than i have ever seen in my life this feel me with what i can only describe a despair the sinking feeling in my gut that i inadvertently killed my friend by letting him use my bike i rush into the emergency room and they are wheeling him into the back he is screaming in pain and a i get closer i can see why right about his knee cap is a massive hole you can see him bone clear a day his pant are red from the blood this scared me more than anything my friend covered in tattoo massively muscular and intimidating is sitting there screaming and cry from pain later on we figured out it wa the foot peg on the bike that dug into his leg and ripped more of his knee out i came back the next day after his initial surgery and he ha staple on his knee area and it looked like something out of a horror movie i sat over there almost everyday after work being there for the screaming and cry during physical therapy helping him get whatever he need he wa in the hospital for about a month or so and he had surgery a couple time after the initial trip to the hospital a you can imagine they loaded him down with painkiller vast amount of them this is where is really start to go down hill i am there every day buying a many pill a i can get my hand on vicodines percs oxys and roxys and whatever you can think of if they made it he got a script for it at least once this cycle drug on for month getting paid going to jeremy is loaded on pill out of pill sick pay check pill on and on at this i had a lot going on in my personal life between my and my family and the people i had chosen to surround myself with i left town and lived at the beach for about a year just grabbed everything i could threw it in my car and left the same day in short i had almost gotten my life together completely during this time period once i felt i had accomplished what i needed to at the beach i head back to my hometown guess who the first person that call me when i get back is jeremy now at this point jeremy ha all his pill and ha also begun experimenting with heroin he look fragile compared to how he used to this man i considered my best friend had changed into a different person a man driven by his need to ingest these narcotic all day every day i get my old job back and he ha somehow maintained his employment there a well and that wa all it took to get me to try heroin the price point compared to pill i could not turn down i sniffed heroin and pill like i sniffed the air around me him and his wife begun shooting up at some point during this period i cannot recall exactly when but i would never put a need in my arm i never did until tragedy struck me and my family month of being back in town and starting this cycle all over again i am at home in my apartment and get a call from the police department the cop want to come to my place and talk to me about my brother a i am sitting there drinking with some girl the cop arrive and i stand in the hallway and speak with him they found my brother in a hotel room about a mile down the road he wa dead in the recliner with the hotel door wide open i wa the only member of my family in town so i had to call my parent and tell them to come back to town tell them their son wa dead and my brother wa gone i sat in the hospital by myself for about an hour by myself until some of my family arrives it wa over hour before my parent arrived from out of town once they got there i left and walked down the street to the bar and took about shot of bacardi i got back to the hotel and the next morning i wake up on the floor of my apartment that wa the most difficult night of my life the phone call to my parent might have been the worse part of it all aside from the actual death of my brother all i could manage to choke out wa you need to come home matthew is dead after i said those word i do not know what i said i just broke down even harder over the phone hearing my mother lose it and my father try to reserve himself in front of her the funeral wa about a week later and i wa to upset to drive well jeremy and his wife were friend with my brother a well and said they would pick me up on the way when they arrive they bust out a baggie and a needle i put up resistance for all of or minute before i gave in i just did not give a fuck anymore about myself or any of those around me the rush i felt the immediate lack of pain the euphoria i had to sit down i thought to myself this is the greatest thing i have ever come across after the initial rush we hopped into the car and went to the funeral once i saw the casket the feeling wa gone and all i felt wa emptiness endless emptiness in retrospect that wa the shittiest thing i had ever done shoot dope before his funeral this feeling just drove my empty feeling further after the funeral i bought a small amount and a clean needle off of them the next month are a blur for the most part an endless cycle of driving a town over buying dope coming home and shooting it eventually i did not even wait to get home and just shot up in the car or at gas station bathroom and the like one day i wa feeling particularly shitty sick missing my brother depression i had drank and beer and popped a klonopin or two a hour or two before i drove to jeremy is where i loaded up i sat on the couch and let that feeling sink in i am dreaming floating through space calm and peaceful in reality i wa a close to dead a you can be i wa in this head space and i just got ripped out of it i am lying on the floor puking like i had never puked before i could make out paramedic around me and my friend off to the side looking at me i am wheeled to the ambulance black in and out i later learned they use two shot of naxolone and one shot of adrenaline to bring me out of it the only clear picture i have of that night wa my father sitting in the chair next to me at the hospital i am not going to lose another child to this fucking shit his face what he said and the way he said it i will never forget it i stayed in the hospital for a few day to make sure detox wa completely done and never put dope in my vein again jeremy on the other hand just got worse and worse but he lost his job so he moved to texas where he had some family this only worsened his problem due to the availability of bth down there the first time i talked to him after he moved that all he could talk about wa how good the dope wa down there we eventually had a falling out and stopped speaking then started talking again and then fell out again the dope had strangled his life and his mind wa breaking under it now on to the terrible news i spoke of at first jeremy wa headed my to my home state he wanted help from me but there wa nothing i could do i had talked to a mutual friend a few day earlier jeremy robbed him after he tried to hang himself in our friend backyard he had to go out there and cut him down when he arrived in nc they arrested him soon a he stepped off the greyhound and sent him back to texas to face other various charge i spoke with his mother yesterday to see what he wa sent back for exactly the drug charge and theft did not surprise me what did and what shook me to my core wa his other charge involving their oldest child she is currently he and his wife were taking pornagraphic picture of her and making money off the picture to support their dope habit this eventually led them to molesting her themselves if not worse i could not bear to know any more than that i took care of their child for year even before the drug ever became involved in my eye they are my own child and i thought about them every day now they are in jail and the kid are lost to me some where in the system if i could find them i would not hesitate to adopt them in a heartbeat me and my fiance are looking into option to do this but i do not think it can become a reality i miss those kid and i love them dearly but i have no idea where they are now this is my story shortened for everyone is sanity,drug_addiction
-33.213223,7.1801147,two thing withdrawing while ill vaping h from a bag bonjour i have been eating opioids daily for the better part of the past year from mg of codeine per day to mg twice daily at some point when otc codeine wa banned in my country i switched to morphine for a couple of month and then to mg of tramadol for the past year i took my last pill exactly week ago i went from mg to mg to mg over day on the th day last sunday i ate an old and disgusting pill of mg of codeine that i had spat out behind my desk month ago the reason i am writing this is because something weird happened i did not start withdrawing like i normally should it had happened once before a couple of year ago i threw up felt the most horrible pain and learned the next day that my goldbladder wa fucked and needed to be removed i wa completely out of codeine and in no condition to drive so i had to quit cold turkey not withdrawing after quitting cold turkey wa very puzzling i wa in so much pain from the dying goldbladder that it felt like my brain wa doing me a kindness on monday i started getting quite sick and assumed that i wa withdrawing it became clear very quickly that i had actually caught a bad virus possibly the flu a my mother wa suffering from the exact same symptom my mother and i are still sick one week later however i did not crave tramadol and i feel like i wa spared again what give doe this happen to you should someone who want to quit cold turkey do it when they are already sick i am planning on staying clean for a while but i do not feel like abandoning opioids i ca not get anything legally anymore i am used to cheap or free opioids and i need this habit to remain affordable i have a volcano vape from when i thought that i liked weed and i wa wondering if vaping heroin with it might be an option it seems reasonably safe since i would be inhaling the heroin slowly from a large bag i feel silly asking if it is even possible to vape heroin any thought if it is an option how much heroin would i need to vape to feel what i usually felt with codeine or tramadol i am good right now but i am sure that i am going to want my happy place back at some point pill are either too expensive or unsafe injecting heroin is out of the question having to smoke it would be a bummer but vaping out of a bag slowly is really appealing for some reason would unwanted fentanyl be a huge concern in this case,drug_addiction

23.54385,30.800058,day slept through the night and feeling semi normal again hello all sorry for the long post but this is my story i have been lurking on these board for the last week or so and they have been very inspiring and encouraging during my suffering i have been addicted to opiate for the last year i am only year old my habit worsened over the last year i wa taking mg of dilaudid a day for month and then switched back to oxycodone and heroin when nothing else wa available i wa taking mg of oxycodone every day or bag of dope and still not feeling good it stopped being about feeling good and started becoming about not feeling bad i decided it wa time to get my life back and decided to quit after a three day taper i had quit in the past for sometimes a long a a month but this time i wa not bargaining with myself and wa serious about quitting for good i started going through withdrawal on the second day of taper it wa mild at first but quickly became the most difficult unrelenting suffering in the world i wa hardly able to sleep for day maybe an hour per night the restless leg syndrome had my bone aching and felt like it wa unceasing i wa throwing up sweating and then shivering back and forth every five minute passing completely liquid stool unable to eat get up or do anything the worst were day and when i suffered full blown withdrawal for the entirety of both day finally with the help of some marijuana i have smoked for the ten year also no intention of quitting that the symptom started slowly decreasing the day have begun to pas normally and every second stopped feeling like an eternity also for the first few day any form of touch felt extremely painful i wa unable to cuddle with or even touch my significant other for these first few day i made sure to explain to her that it wa not her and that the feeling would not last forever this completely faded by the fifth day the key for me getting through the withdrawal were having my incredibly helpful understanding s o to help take care of me and force me to eat and drink a little bit to keep myself healthy i also kept in close contact with a good friend who knew what i wa going through and wa there around the clock for kind supportive word when i needed to hear them a far a easing withdrawal symptom these thing helped but were far from a miracle cure the damage you have done to your body take time to repair and requires some time of suffering to return to normal what go up must come down a they say the best thing for me were a good multivitamin loperamide immodium for anti diarrheal plenty of clear water cranberry juice help detox and clean out the crap in your system egg for protein when i could force myself to eat them and melatonin l theanine zzzquil to help with sleep vitamin c also seemed to give me some energy and orange juice wa another good liquid to give some sustenance other that you just need to keep telling yourself that the suffering will end there is light at the end of the tunnel and it will be worth it if you slip up and use you are just stalling the inevitable unfortunately you must suffer to get through this but you will be much better off because of it anyways day i finally got some decent sleep after purchasing the melatonin zzzquil for sleep aid i felt much better the next morning and day which made the time pas much quicker i stopped feeling so much pain from the cold and started feeling naturally happy and even cracking some smile i also forced myself to go for a walk which wound up leading to a mile jog i slept wonderfully last night without the zzzquil only melatonin i also havent taken loperamide in day and the diarrhea ha almost completely ceased i am beginning to feel my natural endorphin flowing again i just went for a jog run and pushed myself a little farther than yesterday i contacted all my old connection and told them that no matter what i say or do under no circumstance should they ever give me opiate again i then deleted and blocked all of their number using an app i got on my phone that wa a hard decision but i am serious about staying on this track for good anyways there is my story i am far from back to but i feel a million percent better than i did the first few day and a hell of a lot better than when i wa controlled by the drug i picked up the guitar again and am trying to spend a lot of time writing to help occupy my mind tl dr i wa an addict for year and am feeling so much better with my new life after day of opiate withdrawal finally sleeping again and getting my life back to normal,drug_addiction

32.21522,4.9177475,finally broke the cycle of binge eating so i started binge eating two year ago i started it up after developing a disability which made me really depressed and to cope with depression i began binging the binging wa so bad i would bloat and look like i wa pregnant and my breathing would become shallow i went from pound to pound every time i would get depressed feeling i would just eat a much a i could and the binging just made my depression get worse it did not even help with the emotion after a binge rather than just feeling depressed i would also feel guilty and remorseful and the guilt and regret would just cause me to binge some more when i wa le full it wa an awful and physically uncomfortable and painful cycle i decided recently that my binging wa just a bad habit not an addiction when i looked at it that way it wa much easier to change back when i looked at it a an addiction i felt hopeless and like it would be impossible to cure when i viewed it a a habit to cope with emotion it became easier for example when i am anxious i bite my nail would i consider it an addiction nope i looked at binging the same way once i began looking at it a just a bad habit and coping mechanism i began to make a list of activity i could replace it with thing like coffee going for a walk taking a bath playing with my dog reading listening to music and a bunch of other thing so i began trying thing until i found out what stuck the bath thing did not work because it would dry out my skin and waste a ton of water i did not need six bath a day going for a walk wa not good either since i am disabled sometimes i ca not walk and sometimes it just snow but i realized a long a i had my phone i could listen to music and read a much a i wanted so i replaced binge eating with music and reading whenever i felt the urge to binge i would set a minute timer on my phone i agreed that if i still felt the urge to binge after minute then i could do so whenever i felt the urge to binge when feeling depressed i would immediately plug my headphone into my phone put on some music and begin browsing reddit favorite subreddits to browse when depressed are r wholesomememes r earthporn and r upliftingnews i like looking at wholesome stuff nature picture and reading happy news article at first i found even after minute had passed i still had the urge to binge but after two or three week even once the twenty minute timer wa up i still found myself wanting to continue listening to music and looking at reddit rather than binge i no longer get urge to binge at all when depressed it doe not even cross my mind i really hope this help some people basically to sum it up make a list of coping method for whatever emotion cause you to binge try out various thing on the list and see what work best for you when getting the urge to binge set a minute timer and begin doing an activity you picked from the list if the timer go off and you still have the urge to binge then binge it is all about delaying the binge a well a getting your mind into the habit of doing something else instead you will find that you lose the urge to binge eventually because you train your brain to seek that dopamine release in a new way and it begin to crave that new way i really hope this work for other people it help to also change the way you think about binging instead of viewing it a an addiction view it a a bad habit if you view it a a bad habit it becomes so much easier to change viewing it a an addiction give it more power than it actually ha,eating_disorder

instance where i didn t feel loved or wanted that i wa a burden because i am different from my sibling i wa always put in a different box because i had a different dad and no attention wa paid to me because i had more materialistic thing than my sibling because i got two of everything a an adult i crave attention from my mom i don t want too but i do i want to be treated like i m smart and have done well for myself but it doesn t happen it s very hard letting go of this idea i can make it better by being here all the time but i also feel very hurt when i m not invited to thing it s like i ll always be an after thought about month ago my mom aunt and i were out having fun with a couple of friend i wa the designated driver and offered to drive our friend home the plan wa to drop my mom off and my aunt and i go to our friend to hang out before the holiday it wa just meant to be a good night loving the people we were with and just feeling good about being in the moment i wa briefly annoyed with my aunt because she just had to stop and get food for her son even though it wa midnight and the kid should have been asleep a soon a we got back on the road my annoyance dissipated we were singing laughing and dancing we were truly just enjoying each other s company we dropped my mom off with the food and started driving again listening to t pain driving about minute down the road i turned back and looked at my aunt a she wa laughing part of me wish i never looked forward part of me wish i never saw the headlight around am a drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the middle yellow line hitting u head on at highway speed i don t even remember the crash i just remember the all encompassing fear of realizing i wa about to die there wa absolutely nothing i could have done to stop the crash from happening i lifted my head up from the steering wheel and just listened it wa quiet for a few minute until my hearing came back and then it wa just loud people were running back and forth talking to me and my passenger siren going off i listened to my aunt panic in the back seat screaming i wanted to tell her it wa okay but i never got the chance i didn t hear her again i wa trapped in the car for over an hour the dash pushed my knee up to my chest with the steering wheel constricting my movement i knew i wa in bad shape but it wa hard to process it they had to cut the top of the car off lean my seat back a far a possible and slide me out that wa the only time i screamed i remember it all i wa life flighted to a level trauma unit where my amazing orthopedic trauma surgeon stated i needed surgery asap or else i would lose my foot i wa trying to focus on what wa being said around me and not peeing myself while i laid naked on a back board when a detective came and talked to me he asked me question about the accident what i remembered if i had been drinking who i wa with he followed up with i m sorry to inform you but your aunt ha died my aunt died from severe catastrophic injury from a seatbelt that failed it didn t lock how it wa supposed to causing the belt to destroy her inside i felt like i had died with her i wanted to die with her my world tilted on it axis and i just couldn t stop thinking i killed my aunt that she wa dead because of me i could and should have done more it wa like the never ending cycle of grief and self loathing they wheeled me back into surgery and i will never be more grateful for that black nothingness my mind needed i wa in the hospital for week and a nursing home for month unable to walk for and am still attending physical therapy it s an every day struggle just living my body is not my own anymore and it s like learning how to be someone else i lost everything my independence my home my car my life and my cat i lost an aunt who i wa extremely close with i lost so much and i m lost in life my second passenger sustained catastrophic injury and wa briefly paralyzed before they reversed it he s doing mostly okay but still in daily pain from the abdominal surgery my third passenger walked out with cut and bruise but mostly okay the lady who hit u ha two young child the disregard she had for their life is heartbreaking i know she didn t set out to hurt anyone but the consequence of her action have been life altering that s a decision that never should have been made she wa recently sentenced to year prison year probation with a few other provision attached to them i don t know how to react or feel i m sad for her but i m also so angry i can t see straight i find it hard to have gratitude for the people who have been here through it all i didn t ask for this i didn t want this i struggle with the anxiety of every day living and being in a car at night i panic if my mom or sibling are out late and i don t hear from them if something happens in the car when i m not paying attention i have an over exaggerated response i know all of this is part of the ptsd i suffer from

subsequently become overweight i fought through the problem of aspergers and depression i have a few lovely friend in my life they are good people very good people kind considerate little stupid but then who is not i had a fiancee and a small company and a home and a car and a future we were looking at getting married we were looking at adoption my idea for some admittedly mad science design were being built we had a future a beautiful beautiful future my fiancee decided however to go down the path of drug and this unfortunately led to him sexually assaulting me once a well a beating me once or twice his habit cost me almost everything what little finance i had left i used up to leave home and him beyond he took the car i lost my home had to move in with the parent whilst i dealt with crippling debt and the memory of having my dignity removed my condition make working very tricky i survive on the uk is social security program just barely it is just barely enough to cover the cost of the debt and provide for the bill and food more often than i like i have had to make the choice between food or an internet connection my parent are kind and do provide for me but they have their own debt that are eating away at their life this is not my first foray into depression when i wa young i wa very depressed that i could not do all these thing with my brother i could not run or playfight or do combat roll or anything except stand sit or complain when my leg hurt my body at time doe lock up like a cage forming around my limb locking me down ca not really do much in the way of sport without risking it even after going to the gym i need to find somewhere quiet so that i can turn into a bloody statue rage fill me all those missed opportunity my body let me down even when my will wa a strong a iron you ca not climb tree when your hand have a tendency to let go of whatever they were holding he stopped me ending my life quite a few time often enough by sitting on my chest and using my head a a bongo but that is my brother for you the other week my brother took me out on a road trip across europe to take me to a wedding in venice where one of my closest friend wa getting married to the love of his life my brother had also encouraged and supported me in making friend many year ago i have him to thank for taking me to venice protecting me guiding me looking after me and even helping me build strong friendship i could have never afforded it i could not of arranged half of it and he ensured that even my sensory issue were taken care of i loved every second of the trip but i tried to hide the full extent of my condition from him we have not seen each other in quite a few year levodopa ha side effect after all i did not want him to worry about me i also did not want him to see me a a cripple he need to take care of he is a very driven man on that road trip he covered mile and he is only been driving for about five month if he knew i wa writing this i strongly suspect he would tie me up he metaphorically chained up my heart to stop my depression call it a form of conditioning if you will he shout i go quiet he order i obey subconscious snap at me if i do not he want me to be happy to be debt free but my heart died when my finance used me a a cum bucket my debt are insurmountable by the time i have cleared off some and bought food i am already out of money but i am in pain my body even with l dopa still screw up still fuck up nosebleed confusion agitation are other side effect so there is a choice do not take the drug and you ca not move

looked beyond that were unsure if they were homosexual and the one or two who got over those two problem did not inspire any sort of longing in my heart all i could see them a were friend i can never be half the man my brother is my condition wear on me and i will never have the freedom others take for granted like your body not suddenly shutting down on you i am just stuck at home writing my heart out to a possibly indifferent audience i am alone penniless and i want to die but i do not want to hurt my brother i do not want him to suffer i ca not do that to him again he almost fell apart last time i fell into this deep dark pit he put me back together with if you will forgive the poetic bit of me here bit of himself forging a connection between the shattered bit of my mind he would never admit to such weakness but i know him i know him watching me fall apart almost destroyed him i do not know what to do i am not strong enough to live but too much of a coward to die i cannot fight this monster in me anymore i ca not fight depression aspergers and dystonia if only my finance had not hurt me if only dystonia had not happened maybe i could of been a brilliant a him but i am not simply a source of pain and embarrassment to him i do not deserve a brother like him the universe ha made it clear i do not deserve any sort of happiness so i ask the great reddit hivemind what

35.110836,27.791452,just need to vent well im not really sure where to start this im a yr old male unemployed atm not in school just came to move in with my father for the second time im not really sure why im writing this but in all honestly i think it because i feel lie im slowly falling back to being in the position i used to be in when i wa i went back to stay in my hometown from alabama used to live there with my father my hometown is in sc where i lived from also some of the worst day of my life with my grandparent ive always been different from most people which is something i learned at an early age so ive never really had many friend during the time i stayed with my grandparent they werent the typical let me make you cooies and tell you story of their childhood tho my grandmother wa very immature and the kind of person who would take her anger out on everyone around her my grandfather to this day is one of the most greedy backstabbing selfish idiotic people i know he hated me with a passion i dont know why i guess he just used me a an object to take his anger out on because of the fact he had done absolutely nothing with his life whatsoever on top of all this i had zero friend whatsoever and wa often looked at a the nobody in school these thing plus many many many many more thing too many to name really made me feel like an outcast from society because of that i blocked society out when everyone wa at party and with friend during the week and weekend i wa in my room that fucking room locked in a cell blocking the outside world off i made my time up of playing xbox live and listening to music hour and hour on end but in all honestly music wa my escape it probably the only reason im here today when i felt like shit or had a bad day at school id always get home and run to my room and put my headphone in and get lost year of this went by waking up putting my headphone in then playing video game everyday for year can you imagine the thing that can do to a man having nothing to live for other than an ipod an xbox and the vast mass of thought that plagued my mind everyday thought of how fucked up you are how lonely you are the fact that everyone around you know think your an outcast on my th birthday i had hundred of friend on facebook and i didnt get a single happy birthday not one i remember cry in the shower thinking of how fucked up of an individual to not even get one happy birthday i havent had a girlfriend in person in year i think the loneliness wa the worst even still to this day ive always dreamed of finding a girl who i could talk about these thing to preferably someone with issue such a i have depression loneliness feeling like she doesnt fit in and helping eachother get through them ya know someone i could cuddle up to when i felt like shit someone i knew would be there for me through anything and having her know id do the same for her i would an would still do anything to find a girl who genuinely care but im starting to beleive thats just a dream i mean really what girl want a guy like me a depresed awkward antisocial man with an obsession with music the thing is if i had that girl id give her the whole world if i could id tell her i love her everyday so shed never forget id give her flower and candy and whatever else she wanted but they want the guy who treat them like shit and cheat on them idk why a girl will make a guy who would treat them like a queen feel like shit then go give a guy who view them a an object their heart ive never understood it well i cant say that all girl and guy are like that im sorry just a little pissed right now and the thing is i dont even think im that bad looking anyway back to topic i beleive i left off at how shitty and pointless my life wa it wa rare i had a day where i actually thought of the positive about me ive always been proud of my view toward woman the whole dont cheat be a gentleman to your girl and treat her right thing i guess i get that from my childhood my mother and stepdad were drug addict i would often see my stepfather beating on my mother i never want to be anything like him another thing i liked about myself wa my intelligence i never had any class where i wasnt top of the class other than math and yes i have very good grammar but am too emotional to focus on that while writing this i honestly beleive i have alot of common sense and consider myself a bit of a philosopher i ponder life and death and the meaning of life very often im really good at being around people meeting people etc ive got a pretty good mask i put on in front of stranger im a very hard worker but it very rare i recognize these thing i usually focus on the negative i do have a dream tho i want to change the world i want to peace to everyone ya know end world hunger make the world a better place i beleive if the world ever doe become a paradise were gonna be the one who start it the nobody reject etc because we see the extent of how fucked up and twisted and unfair society really is i cry sometimes not just for me but for others i hate seeing other people miserable like me i get on suicide watch pretty often and try to talk to others and brighten their day up but it hard for me to come up with reason someone else should be happy with their life when i cant even find a reason to be happy with mine i wish i wa a billionaire or something id give money to those who need it i wish there wa a way for me to make every single person who feel like they dont amount to shit have everything and more they want out of life anyway not sure where i left off but well just skip to where i move out of my grandma one day my cousin came home from germany me and him have been more like brother since birth i go and stay with him at my grandpa on the

-12.573092,23.58644,resignation from life thing have been hard for me recently recently is not exactly right it really been the last or so year to be more accurate my story is similar to a lot of people that i have read on here i lurk a lot grew up being bullied grew up having zero friend horrible self esteem issue lot of negativity ton of self hate the work childhood and early adolescence during this time obviously had impact on my life later on all of these feeling have just gotten worse with time and a the taunting and doubt of early adolescence developed into further negativity depression and self hatred in later year i am now but i do not feel like it at all i feel completely foreign and alien to everyone around me i feel like i do not understand anyone and no one understands me i have no friend zero relationship experience no job experience and no real hope going onward the more i think about life going forward the more i begin to realize that thing just are not going to get better everyone will come and say that the future is a mystery and it better to just stick around and see what happens but you could have told me that advice year ago when i wa in a similar state and the way that i feel would be identical to now nothing ha changed thing have really actually gotten worse year ago i wa not in ten of thousand of dollar of college debt for a worthless degree year ago i still had some sense of blind optimism or naivety to dream about year ago i still have a slight minuscule amount of hope that maybe thing would turn around in college but that did not happen my college year have only cemented my sense of resignation after being bullied in middle and high school i thought college would be a new and fresh start somewhere that i could reinvent myself and have friend and happiness for once that wa not the case college wa just a further extension of the ostracism bullying and loneliness that i felt while i wa younger i felt like a ghost my entire college career only coming into physical being to be the butt end of joke or when people needed to use me a a human textbook for help with classwork or quiz i thought that maybe for once in my life i would be able to feel some sort of companionship no that is not really the right term here the real word i am trying to convey is a sense of normalcy being this alone this sad this anxious all the time robs you of your humanity you do not feel like you exist you do not feel like you are meant to be among others you start to feel like your existence is some sort of divine mistake that there is no way someone a worthless a yourself could ever exist in a just world but lo you do i got to a point during my final semester at college where i wa at my breaking point up to that point that wa the lowest i had ever felt i had not been to class in almost week and i did not want to risk my parent finding out about my grade dropping significantly so i finally talked to a therapist she wa beneficial mainly because she allowed me to vent and talk about my thought similar to how i am right now scheduling made it so we were only able to meet four time during the course of the semester and on the last day i agreed and signed a release form to allow her to call my mom to try to get me some help with the way that i feel for when i eventually moved back home in the day leading up to the phone call i wa an anxious wreck i knew it wa coming i knew that i would have to face the music at some point and come clean to her about the real reason why i appeared so tired and lethargic all the time and it wa not a conversation i wa eager to partake in but deep down i knew it wa what i needed to do if thing kept on progressing a they were i would more than likely jump off a cliff eventually my mother got the phone call from my therapist i know that she got it because my therapist called me to let me know that she told her about it and for me to give her an update later on so all that remained wa the waiting game an hour passed and then a day and then a week and then a month and then two it became apparent that nothing wa going to happen either she completely misunderstood what my therapist meant by extremely depressed or she doe not seem to care regardless the point remains that i am now back at home living with my parent no friend no place to vent nothing i am just alone with my thought all day i have applied for job and have gotten a few interview and for almost all of them i have been told that i am overqualified for the position this is the final laugh of the education system being told that if you do not have a degree you will suffer an existence of flipping burger well i have a degree and i would kill for a basic minimum wage flipping burger and now i am being told that i wo not be a motivated worker because i decided student debt wa a logical decision priceless to bring this rambling mess to a conclusion i have no real reason to believe that life is ever going to get any better in the future near or far i have been plagued with low self esteem self hate anxiety depression and a myriad of other negative emotion for too long to draw any other conclusion other than that my life is going to be long pitiful and sad for however long i live there is no avenue in my life that i can see good no friend no job no girlfriend no social circle no therapist or drug to aid me i will never kill myself this is not some defiant statement against the abyss this is a resignation to the reality that i am in a purgatory of sort forever feeling dead but unable to become it i have read too many story on reddit and chan about the impact of suicide on survivor and while my family may not have any real understanding of the way that i feel the impact of an unexpected suicide would destroy them for that fact i am forced to bear this cross for a long a i live it is heavy it break my back and ravage my body but for their sake i have to bear it on my own i really do not know why i typed all of this out to be honest over the past year or so i have posted a lot of thread like this on r suicidewatch hoping to get some form of answer or clarity but to no avail that is not a dig at any of the people that take their time to try to save the lost soul here it just a realization of the extent of my own issue just to clarify i am not going to do anything drastic any time soon if ever i just needed to empty some thought out into the void somewhere at least appropriate thanks for reading,suicidality
