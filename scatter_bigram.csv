-32.65003,-63.085846,i am free at last i have been trying to stop for a while weed ha ruined my life the plant itself ha not ruined it but just the number of time cop have intervened in my life and used pot a a reason to pull me over or give me a ticket or harass me in my own home because i wa growing a plant i only needed pot really to get me through a bad break up and to get me past my cancer and then i moved to a state where pot wa not very friendly and where it is become prohibitively difficult to get it anyways therefore this transition while it is been slow is finally here to where i have not smoked in two week and the initial urge i had are largely gone now which is just a reinforcement to me that this is a mental addiction and not a physical addiction so for those of you who need to quit pot strictly because it is illegal or because it is prohibitively expensive where you live then solidarity,addiction
-33.393826,-63.50183,becoming an adult and recovering from foolishness day this definitely go beyond the scope of r leaf but my pot habit is very a big part of this story i tried to make this comprehensive but brief forgive the meandering narrative with it clumsy temporal perspective it feel very narcissistic and selfish to post something like this when there are much more grave and serious thing happening to people all over the world but i have been going through a rough time for me and felt the need to write this out i have been getting high on weed almost daily for the past year i smoked for the very first time in th grade but it wa not until my rd year of college that i got into weed developed a daily habit though i wa smoking constantly i kept my grade up earned my degree on time and also made some personal accomplishment in that time made new friend and a new lover leveled up many time over at the gym after graduating with my liberal art degree lol yay i had no idea what i wanted to do career wise i moved back in with my parent continued to get high every day and had wild fantasy of entrepreneurial pursuit i dreamed of making decent money a an independent fitness consultant and not having to answer to anybody except client i made a decidedly weak attempt at realizing this dream which failed i could not focus or organize myself to the degree necessary for launching a small business from scratch after brushing off this failure which wa easy a i barely tried i did manage to get a full time call center job and wa able to move out of my parent house for the next year i worked various customer service job of varying level of shittiness but each time i got a new job it paid slightly better and had more perk for the most part i hated the work itself i lamented that i worked a shit job while i wa capable of doing much more i always needed to smoke weed after work it made me feel relaxed but also made me feel like i wa still a budding entrepreneur always brainstorming however i found that i never really got around to doing any of the project or idea i would come up with when i wa giddy with creativity after getting high recently at a very decent for a call center gig i convinced myself that i hated the job and that it wa a detriment to my relationship and mental health i resigned thinking that i wa finally ready to figure it all out i did not line up another job before leaving i convinced myself that after quitting the menial job i did not like my mind would be free to make some quantum leap and i would finally amake something happen that i would find job satisfaction or finally realize my dream of self employment on a logical level i knew at the time that this wa very unrealistic thinking i knew that career change and self employment do not come quickly or easily i had planned prior to quitting the job that i would also quit smoking weed when i quit at least until i had stuff figured out surprise surprise my perfect new livelihood did not magically materialize a i had hoped i took a painstaking week break from pot before backsliding into a week of heavy smoking and edible with a buddy i fantasized and brainstormed about how i would start a business and be on my way towards financial independence but i did not take any action week passed while i lazed about enjoying summertime funemployment a my financial situation began to dawn on me i began to freak out a bit i started planning for imminent poverty and applying to crappy part time job that i knew i did not want to work i resolved to quit nicotine mainly due to the cost but also for the satisfaction of beating an addiction i would been hooked since and wa scared that the withdrawal would be intense i am happy to report that they were not so bad it is been or week without nicotine but i had continued to smoke weed until today the part time job i wa setting up a stop gap have since fell through i can only assume that the hiring manager inferred that i would not be sticking around very long i am relieved despite my concern about running out of money i loathe working under inept people i hate being paid poorly to work my as off to generate profit for someone else i hate that this all might come off like i think i am too good for a regular job but maybe that is not so far from the truth at the very least i have a very strong desire to be self employed and not have to answer to a bos today is a new woulday one for me part of it is not wanting to be dependent on it part of it is not having money to buy more and part is knowing that i need to figure my shit out real fast or else my bank account will dry up and i will really be fucked i am finally facing up to the apparent fact that i stunted my own maturity with my weed habit when in doubt i would always assure myself that getting high if anything made me better at navigating life i hope that i have been dead wrong all these year i hope for my own sake that i am sharper more capable and productive without ganja i feel both an existential and pragmatic need to make my dream happen fast i am not scared about withdrawal trouble sleeping or missing the ritual or comfort i am scared about giving it my sober all and failing for real,addiction

4.2585096,98.721664,day and feelin fine then v now not too long ago i knew that i needed to stop smoking so i did i smoked the rest of my stash told a few friend so i would have someone to hold me accountable and settled in for the ride the physical symptom were not bad some sleep weirdness sweating a ton no appetite but my mood wa horrendous i wa an absolute asshole to the most important people in my life and swung from depressed to filled with rage to irritated depending on how bad i decided my situation wa the only thing keeping me smoke free wa willpower and a it tends to do it ran out at the ten day mark ten day of being a miserable bastard and lamenting about how much i wa missing out on because i could not escape myself with pot flash forward to now and i am five day in and feeling great definitely have to check my crankiness at time and have not had much to eat but other than that i feel like a new man the difference meditation meditation is something i cannot recommend highly enough it give you insight into how your mind work and that sick part of your mind that want nothing more than to stay numb and dumb for a long a you live is your most deceptive enemy and the key to defeating any enemy is to understand them and to understand yourself understanding yourself and addiction escapism is the key when you meditate your mind doe not want to be still you will be bombarded by pesky thought about thing you need to do at work and at school more often than not which is plenty difficult a is really rough day your brain will be so frustrated with having to sit still that it decides to up the ante and lob thought it know will make you feel genuinely stressed scared or just plain bad the time you threw up at that party the fact you got a test coming up and probably wo not pas whatever this is your monkey mind it chitters and chat and want thing that feel good and safe and to avoid being uncomfortable or scared at all cost and nothing is more frightening than leaving your escape from the world and getting your shit together it gonna be hard even if you start with just twenty minute like i did this is not something i naturally like to do without even realizing it i have avoided any sort of mental silence for most of my adult life if i am not watching tv playing video game i have headphone in anything to not be alone with me when you meditate it is just you and your thought you will be amazed with what your brain is gonna try you with but when it throw every distracting or negative thought at you and you still do your best to still your mind and just exist you will realize they are just that thought feeling and thought are not fact and you can be the captain of your ship get to know yourself spend more time with your thought become more disciplined physically and mentally i have always worked out but emotionally i wa a weak a anybody who ha ever lived research modern approach to emotional wellbeing and read some philosophy a far a anybody know this go around is all we got so we got to make it count you may be weak now or even think of yourself a weak but never before ha it been this easy to improve and grow so if you have ever even considered meditating try it set a timer for twenty minute and close your eye and still your mind when a thought present itself you just let it float by like a leaf on a pool of water you do not have to push them out the key is to not chase them a single negative thought is what lead me to relapsing the first time it wa the first link in the chain that make up the shackle i put myself in you ca not stop negative thought but meditation and other mindfulness exercise can lead you to understanding that you do not have to follow them anywhere either when it pop up you can say i see you buddy nice try brain and redirect your thought elsewhere everybody tell you to exercise and eat right when you quit but your mind is all you really have and if you are anything like me it could use some sharpening,addiction

-41.627384,-63.774113,after day smoked a little bit for day remembered why i quit i quit smoking on june after year or so of smoking daily almost all the time except work hour the first week wa utter hell the nd and rd were full of mood swing and self doubt about if life will ever feel okay again and by week i wa feeling good good in the sense that i wa not having mood swing the same and depressive episode reduced from nearly full time when smoking to maybe a few hour per week i wa finally able to feel the ups in the ups and down of life then last week i wa on vacation with my friend for the weekend they had very mild edible so i figure screw it i am on vacation and that evening we were just hanging around my friend is apartment eating and drinking beer anyway so why not i wa a bit concerned that i wa losing my streak giving up or relapsing but i choose eat the edible anyway in truth none of those particular fear held true but on the whole my experience wa a negative one for a few reason i wa just out of it speaking stupidly and out of sequence being socially inappropriate etc i did not feel social or like going out i wa anxious both while high and also the morning day after i fell asleep on the couch watching tv with a bunch of people i did not really have control over when i fell asleep the tiredness would just overwhelm me the next morning i wa groggy and tired a hell it took me a few hour to feel like i had woken up and even then i did not have the same pep to my day a i had before when i had quit and of course the worst compounding effect a part of me wanted to smoke the next day i did smoke the next day splitting a spliff with a friend before bed same problem a i said above but the part of me that wanted to smoke overcame the part of me that understood that on the whole it wa not worth it i did it the next evening too this time before we even went out to a bar the addiction getting stronger again with repeated use finally i smoked some the morning of my flight with my friend a he drove me to the airport might a well get really high in the sky especially if i am on vacation and it is my last day right then when i returned in the evening i hung out with a girl i have been seeing and we stayed at her place and smoked weed again i wa super awkward while high which even if this girl seemed chill and awkward when high too i definitely do not want to be that way when it is just my rd or th time seeing her but again the weed came above all last night i did not smoke which would be the first day since that mini binger even though i only smoked a very small amount each of those day and even though they were only in the evening except the day of the flight morning evening i can feel the repercussion even now my stomach is tweaked i am not a awake a i would be otherwise and i am a bit skittish nervous long story short yes i can smoke a little bit and not completely get back into smoking daily i did very small amount and did not smoke all day but it simply is not worth it the gain do not outweigh the pain not just in a long term sense but even in a short term sense being high just is not fun anymore it is not cause i ca not feel high but because i also feel all the negative effect even at the same exact time a i am high plus the effect the next day,addiction

-14.154946,71.838066,five month pregnant sober with my tip for pregnancy leaving this is long but i hope that if there are other people here who are expecting a baby and trying to quit my story and advice are useful before getting pregnant i wa a daily user i work a to job and would smoke pretty much from the time i got home from work until bedtime and most of my waking hour on weekend i used tree to self medicate anxiety depression and insomnia even successfully discontinuing prescription medicine for them after replacing them with tree and although i live in a state where it is illegal i would definitely have my medical use card if i lived in a legalized state after year of marriage and consideration my husband and i decided that it wa time to start trying for a baby which i knew meant i needed to quit i tried quitting once before actually getting pregnant and it wa a disaster i made it through three week of depression sleeplessness irritability and despondency before giving up and going back to my tree guy for another baggie my husband wanted to help me quit but knew better than to try to force me to do anything against my will and anyway i ca not deny that stoned sex is better for me and we were trying to conceive i did not expect to conceive a quickly a we did which is why i wa not actually trying to quit yet when we found out that i wa pregnant it is embarrassing to admit but i wa stoned when i peed on the stick that said yes i would had zero mother is intuition about being pregnant and i really truly expected the stick to say no but there it wa it might a well have said you have just quit congratulation this is about to suck i wo not sugar coat it quitting daily habit cold turkey during the first trimester of pregnancy is hard i wa clutched with near constant nausea fatigue and emotional upheaval for week unable to focus at work vomiting every day and bursting into tear at the drop of a hat of course those are perfectly normal healthy symptom for many people in their first trimester of pregnancy it killed me though that i knew my perfect go to solution for nausea and anxiety hoping for permission to resume using i did some online research on the effect of tree and pregnancy and at best the result seemed inconclusive there were some the plural of anecdote is data article that claimed it increased the risk of complication low birthweight et al and even pro tree website were not able to say anything more promising than there is not enough research to show that it is definitely safe or harmful i read one article about a pregnant woman in oregon whose doctor wrote her a prescription to treat her pregnancy induced nausea and anxiety upon reading i barked an angry jealous laugh at her nausea and anxiety is part of pregnancy lady whose kid wa born premature and with complication and the article wa about her contemplating breastfeeding while continuing to use about doctor warning her against potentially hurting her child is neurological development my mind wa made up i wa not going to risk hurting my baby or even wondering but not knowing if i would hurt my baby i did not want my baby whisked off to the nicu because i could not control my addiction i did not want to watch my kid struggle in school ten year from now wondering if their problem were my fault i certainly did not want to risk a battle with child protective service if thc wa ever found in the blood urine of me or my newborn i did not want to be that lady in oregon my pregnancy wa putting me through hell but like the churchill saying go when you are going through hell keep going shortly after that while home alone and feeling nauseated and lonely and sad i opened back up my stash box smelling my grinder contemplating my little baggie which still had about a bowl is worth remaining plus a considerable amount of kief in the bottom of my grinder i knew knew that i wa too vulnerable to have it in the house that i wa either going to smoke it and finally get relief from my vomiting and panic attack or that i needed to get rid of it i dumped the baggie in the toilet and ran the grinder under the sink cry a i watched it rinse away really i should have removed the temptation earlier there were a couple of benefit to detoxing during my first trimester first i slept really well i have always been bad at sleeping tree had been my insomnia cure for year and the first time i tried to quit the insomnia wa one of the worst part about it however woman in their first trimester tend to sleep really hard really long and i had no trouble falling asleep and staying asleep due to my body is response to pregnancy another benefit i could blame all my emotional symptom on the pregnancy the first time i tried to quit i did nothing but mope and cry a a result and felt terribly guilty for inflicting my sad sack self on loved one this time i got nothing but sympathy and love and awww the pregnant lady is cry again those baby hormone are really something whenever i broke down and i wo not lie that helped a lot that i never felt blamed or judged for being the weepy hermit that i sometimes needed to be to cope i took the following step which i would recommend to anybody in my position get the tree out of your house i should have done this earlier myself but it took me about a month between quitting and flushing because i wa not ready to let go of the safety net feeling of having the option i would have tortured myself much le if i would just gotten rid of everything sooner take all the advice you can find on coping with nausea for me this included wearing sea band basically nibbling on tummy gentle food regularly sucking on peppermint other pregnant people find lemon or ginger candy helpful drinking lot of unflavored carbonated water others find ginger ale soothing and avoiding known nausea trigger like strong smell or leaning over too quickly seriously there are a million anti nausea suggestion out there and they wo not all work for anybody but some of them will work for everybody try them all and make a note of and stick with whatever work for you avoid anything that trigger your craving to use for me i had my husband rearrange the house to put the television in another room to break my this is where i sit and pack my bowl and watch tv physical habit i also stopped watching tv show and reading blog that featured celebrated tree usage they just made me jealous and angry also do not hang out with people who are stoned i am lucky in that my husband had no problem quitting with me he only smoked occasionally anyway but if the person who knocked you up is also a regular smoker it is definitely time for them to quit in solidarity with you take advantage of the hard sleep you get in the first several week of pregnancy but when this phase of pregnancy end you will be faced with the eternal pregnant at night problem waking up to pee constantly to fall back asleep quickly never ever ever look at your phone when you wake up and do not turn on the light when you go to the bathroom use a nightlight or just leave on the hallway light with the door open but do not expose yourself to any overhead light or electronic glare this one took me a while to figure out but my falling back asleep time went from minute to le than minute once i made this change the nightmare are probably going to be intense pregnant people get hardcore dream and people quitting tree get hardcore dream and holy shit i hate to report this but i still get horrible nightmare almost every night probably night a week i do not have any good tip for this other than remembering nightmare are like poop in that your body make them so you can get shit out of your system and once you wake up do not dwell on them or try to remember them just let them flush away with the people who knew about your tree habit brag about quitting you will get nothing but support and people will be relieved to hear that you have quit do not be shy about telling them how hard it is been you are doing something hard and those who love you will have no trouble understanding why it is hard and why you are doing it anyway and truly anybody who is not fully supportive of a pregnant person not smoking really doe not belong in your life anymore so where am i now healthy sober and with a pregnancy that is humming along perfectly i just had my week ultrasound and everything looked great all indicator are normal the baby is the right size and i am proud of myself for taking care of both of u it is been some of the hardest few month of my life but the reward of knowing that i have taken my pregnancy this far and that all is well ha made this huge change worth it i ca not wait to meet my baby daughter in a few month for obvious reason this is a throwaway reddit account but i am happy to answer any question people may have particularly from people who are either pregnant or trying to conceive while simultaneously trying to quit take care everybody,addiction

14.33577,41.809593,a little unconventional but i would appreciate anyone reading this who is feeling optimistic first let me start off by saying that i just made this account for my husband he ha tossed around the idea of making a reddit account to help him stop drinking and just never ha i thought that if i made him an account and shared a little bit of his story that if he got on here and had some support right off the bat that it would do him a world of good so here is a very basic run down of what is going on at he ha been drinking for well over half of his life heavily and i mean heavily he polish off over a fifth of vodka daily always wa the most happy outgoing and charismatic person you would likely meet very entrepreneur minded and his self proclaimed reason for living wa to be a daddy once his first baby wa born that is he ha super awesome kid age and the two youngest are ours together him and i have been together just about year married for of them i am year old his oldest is from his first marriage and life several state away he ha been in therapy for going on two year because drinking is quite literally killing him it is destroying everything good in his life he come from a family of heavy drinker he is the only one who ha not lost his family because of it but that is a lot to do with the fact the i remember who he is and i have not given up not always an easy choice for me his amazing wonderful happy self that wa unusually optimistic in the last few year he ha become a shell of that person always angry very depressed he requested help from our family physician and while they were very impressed that he acknowledged he ha a major problem they do not deal with addiction and gave him a list of councilors so off to counseling he went after about month he wa doing great feeling like he wa ready to kick the drinking habit feeling like he had his thought sorted out enough to back off from once a week to every other week he sobered up for a full day could not sleep had tremor very sick itchy all over super bad depression so he started drinking again attempted to stop multiple time only to fall back into it after day or week he started spending all of his time that he wa not at work in bed drinking he became apathetic backed off on counseling to once a month his therapist saying how improved he ha gotten every time he talk a great game he warned her of this when he started because he know that he can convince anybody to think what they want about him even the pro is she started cutting the visit short saying there wa a more urgent case waiting well i had a problem with this a huge ethic problem to tell you the truth i told him this suggested he find a new therapist who will actually be available a often a necessary once he started doing poorly again he realized that he should not have backed off his appointment and attempted to get them back to weekly no time in her schedule though his family ha been insane and they do not seem like they care at all if he drink himself to death or loses his family over it which is why i suggested that he make a reddit account and create connection with people who actually understand what he is going through and can identify with him i can only do so much i am not an alcoholic i have no idea what it is like from his side of the fence but i can tell you all what it is like from the side of the spouse who ha watched the slow deterioration and decline of someone they love more than anything i ca not make the choice for him but he want more than anything to stop drinking i can tell he is afraid it is too late health wise but it is not i need him to know that people have come through this battle and won i know it is one day at a time but some day just fucking suck i get that i want him to remember how amazing he is which is not easy i also get that a soon a he sobers up he start realizing how much of life he doe not remember and the part that do start coming back are not always that pleasant he hate who he ha become but i do not believe that is who he ha become he just need to remember who he is i understand that it ha changed him this disease ha changed all of u but i am so confident that if he can just find the support he need from people who can identify with his situation that he can use the change to better himself he work ha a good job carry good insurance he provides monetarily for u that is a big deal these day i know this and appreciate it and try my best to make sure he feel appreciated and loved i think it is important to note that he is agnostic if not fully atheist so am i so that is not an area of conflict or anything but it make aa really unappealing to him the step are based on believing in a higher power which is obviously a problem when you do not believe in one i know that he is fully capable of doing this on his own without a higher power everyone is until very recently he ha sworn that this disease wa not going to beat him he never quit trying but i see him giving up he is so close to just being defeated that is why i am here this is the only post i will be making on behalf of him when he get home from work tonight i will be handing this account off to him and keeping my nose right out of it i just thought that it would be pretty amazing if i could hand it to him and have him feeling some sense of community and support from the get go thank you all in advance i have spent a lot of time over the last few year reading in this subreddit because it help me to understand his perspective i am not sure what anyone can offer him advice wise but anything that is helpful and realistic would be awesome he did stop for month just about year ago felt confident that he wa able to just enjoy a beer without falling back into this full force now he is aware that it is not an option for him to have a casual drink if he can just stop long enough to get through the hell that come with quitting mentally and physically thank you to anyone who might read this and offer some type of support whether or not anyone feel like they should private message or just comment on this post it doe not matter to me he is ready to try again can anyone please just give him a nudge towards realizing that it is possible and that he can do it,alcoholism

-7.439503,94.494774,using sleep a an escape one of the main reason why i used to binge drink wa to escape my life and my problem for at least a couple honor you know what i mean wanting to feel numb and stop my mind from thinking about stuff that wa bothering me alcohol can actually do this well for a few hour but then i would wake up the next day feeling sick and realizing all my problem were still there actually alcohol make thing a lot worse because you could use all that time spent drinking and being hungover to instead try to heal and fix your problem at their source it is also medically proven that people who use alcohol often to hide their anxiety or depression end up more stressed and more anxious in the long term anyway i have noticed that a good night is sleep can also be a great escape and it doe not come with any hangover or deep regret i realize a lot of people have sleep problem but if you are able to get into bed in a quiet place and sleep comfortably for several hour that is honestly a wonderful escape you will not be thinking about your problem at all and your mind will be numb to what wa bothering you the only exception are if you have a nightmare or if you toss and turn a lot sober sleep is really good i am currently week sober and i sleep a lot better than when i used to drink sleeping through the night is a great way for me to hit pause on my problem and my stress and dream about a more peaceful happy life,alcoholism

20.071026,-28.779179,not an alcoholic but my boyfriend of year is not sure how to help him or if the relationship can even be saved hey all not sure if this is the right subreddit for this if it is not appropriate please just let me know i do not have a drinking problem but my boyfriend doe and it is putting a lot of strain on our relationship i am not sure how to deal with it anymore and i wa just looking for some perspective from someone who ha experienced alcoholism firsthand so my boyfriend and i have been together for year living together for the past month i love him very much and until lately have had very intention of spending the rest of my life with him of course no relationship is perfect but i have no complaint about him or the relationship at all other than this problem but it is a big one and that is why i am struggling with what to do when we first started dating he did not have a drinking problem we both like to drink and would sometimes go out and drink maybe a little more than we should a most people our age do from time to time we are now and but never drank heavily more than maybe once a week we would occasionally have a drink with dinner but even that wa never a daily thing it never seemed too abnormal or unhealthy to me then he started drinking liquor instead of beer because it wa cheaper that way he is very frugal which is one of the thing i love about him we were long distance for the first month of our relationship and only saw each other on weekend so i noticed him drinking more and more when we hung out but i always figured hey it is the weekend i like to drink too no big deal by the time i moved to his city to be closer to him and we started hanging out daily i realized he wa drinking quite a bit shot of whiskey and maybe a couple beer even during the week but i tried to turn a blind eye to it like i said i like to drink too and his behavior wa never a problem and i did not want to nag by the time we moved in together a little over a year into our relationship he wa drinking shot of whiskey per night and usually a couple beer a well he hated his job wa struggling to finish his degree and wa very depressed it wa clear he wa using the alcohol to self medicate i still kept my mouth shut about the drinking for the most part a he wa having such a hard time a few month later quit his job and finally went to a therapist and went on prozac and wa able to finish his degree he wa doing much better all around except the drinking wa still bad even escalating some since he wa unemployed for a month or so and wa able to sit around and drink all day while i wa gone at work finally thing came to a head when i made dinner for u one night and he wa too drunk to hold a conversation with me i told him it wa me or the drinking he agreed he had a problem and had been trying to cut back but it wa not enough progress for me we both stopped drinking entirely for about week and it wa very hard for him i know but he said himself that he felt much better le depressed etc then we started drinking only when we are out to dinner or with friend never keeping it in the house then we said we could drink in the house but only on weekend then we said we could keep beer in the house any time but no liquor since then he ha told me that he want to do this on his own and he drink liquor several night a week but only a half pint at a time i do not know what to do i have tried to hold him accountable but he say that just make him feel stressed and judged and make him want to drink more a few time i have asked him if he is been drinking and he lie and say he ha not then when i ask again he admits that he ha i will not tolerate lying in my relationship especially about this and he said the solution wa not to be so hard on him when he doe slip up because that make him want to lie about it i understand that but i am afraid if i do not say anything he will go right back to where he wa his drinking escalated a lot while we were together and he never really started to cut back until i nagged him to so now i feel somehow responsible for his sobriety i know he is the only one who can stop drinking for himself but i just do not know how to support him without enabling him too and it upset me when he drink like that i am probably oversensitive to it because my dad ha a drug problem so i have seen firsthand what substance abuse ha done to him my mom and my family i never want that for myself with my partner i also work in a hospital and see people who have literally drank themselves to death almost daily it make me so scared that that is in his future at the same time his behavior when drinking is almost never a problem half the time i would not even know he had been drinking if i wa not sitting there watching him do it he is never mean or abusive or unhappy when drunk he is never hurt himself or broken anything or gotten a duo the worst thing that happens is he fall asleep and i am sad because we do not get to hang out or whatever or he get a little silly and kind of annoying because he want to play with my hair or something when i am trying to sleep just dumb basically harmless stuff like that but i worry about him so much i have pretty bad depression and anxiety myself which i manage with therapy and medication and if i am out at night and he fall asleep and doe not answer his phone for hour i get freaked out i work out of town couple of day a month and almost every single time he go on a binge because i am gone and he is passed out by pm i like to talk to him on the phone before bed when i am out of town but when he pass out without warning like that i do not get to and then i get worried because i am not there so i do not know if he is okay and i ca not get a hold of him what if he pass out with the oven on what if he ha an accident and i do not know because i assume he is just passed out drunk he say he want to cut back and it is true that he already ha significantly he say it would be easier for him to work on his drinking if i just did not interfere either way but it is so hard for me to just sit by and not say anything when he say he is cutting back but he end up drinking liquor more night than he doe not sometimes it feel like he is not trying or not trying hard enough but i know it is really hard and i do not understand because i have never had that problem i do not know if i am overreacting or underreacting or what it is harder too because i like to drink myself and i think i am more open to drinking than most people i honestly would not mind if he had a couple of beer and maybe even a few shot of bourbon a day i do not care if he is over what health official say is healthy i just want him to reign it in to a reasonable amount but it is like every time i give an inch he take a mile maybe he is just not capable of drinking in moderation maybe it is all or nothing for him he seems to think he can cut back on his own but maybe he is just in denial i just do not know what to do i love him so much and would love to stick with him and help him get through this if it is something that can and will get better but i ca not spend the rest of my life this way i would be willing to give up alcohol completely and be sober with him for the rest of my life if that is what he need i can be patient if that is what he need but sometimes it feel like it is never going to get better and i ca not keep worrying about and fighting over this for the rest of my life i guess my question is is there any hope should i stay and try to help or should i cut my loss and go and if i do stay how can i help him let him handle this on his own or try to hold him accountable i have talked to my friend and family member a little about it but none of them have ever had to deal with alcoholism personally i just need some perspective on my situation and how to handle it i guess i guess i should mention too that he is no longer in therapy he had to stop seeing his old therapist because he graduated college she wa employed by the college for student only and he ha not been able to find one he like since though he ha not tried very many and say he doe not think he need it anyway he is also very reluctant to go to aa though i have encouraged him to go and told him i would go with him sorry this post is so jumbled i tried to include all the relevant information i

60.73686,26.226957,panic attack thwarted one of the main reason i quit drinking in november wa the increasing frequency of really scary middle of the night panic attack that would wake me up and last for hour i hadn t had one in month originally stopped drinking in early nov drank twice in mid fev then last night about an hour after i fell asleep that old smothering feeling woke me up i don t know what brought it on i didn t eat have caffeine etc in the hour before bed but it took me right back to the darkness even if not drinking related the fact that i wa able to take half and ativan prescribed for panic attack and go right back to sleep is a huge step up i used to have to take an entire ativan and listen to meditation apps and they d still last for over an hour so this is a big improvement actually maybe this is paw related feeling pretty good otherwise with zero desire to drink this time around,alcoholism

53.82332,9.049155,would anyone like to share their story of rockbottom paranoia health relationship problem etc a of these past couple of year my drinking ha become something uncontrollable i have always been a heavy drinker but i never considered it a problem until recently it began when i accepted a job where of the time i wa working from home this wa my first adult job where a before i field technician that clocked a standard m f hour day needle to say i spent a considerable amount of time drinking with all the down time i had somehow i managed to pull off the functional alcoholic a i maintained and did well at my job in the course of my tenure this despite the fact that on more than one occasion showing up to work and attending conference call practically slurring sneaking drink in the company bathroom etc it wa around the beginning of that job i met a woman who wa an alcoholic a well she would encourage my drinking and i started to feel a though she wa a bad influence she wa also controlling and emotionally abusive and very clearly did not like being in a functional relationship she would lie gaslight yell and generally being a ornery a possible when she did not get her way with the heavy drinking came a feeling of being trapped in my own apartment with this obviously unstable person who degenerated into this unattractive drunk monster i ended up very clearly telling her to get the hell out of my life a i needed someone to blame for this feeling of dread that if i stayed with her she would be the end of me the thing wa i did not want to break up with her i just needed a sense of control and with her living with me i did not have that i started to believe she wa poisoning me a it seemed like i never had energy anymore and would spend day holed up drunk and or asleep half the time i thought i would be better off without her in influence and i sobered up for about a month and started feeling better again but with the lonliness startting to creep in i tried dating but could not really connect with anyone i started losing confidence and with that my drinking shot up to a new high i gave up dating and became a drunk angry hermit culminating to what i guess you could describe wa a nervous breakdown i had gun in my place and i wa afraid i would need to use them on myself because it felt a though i could not even control my own thinking i wa becoming obsessive with the past and would play traumatic event in my life over and over in my head like a broken record panic attack daily i started to feel a though i wa somehow displaying the hell that wa going on in my head and started becoming extremely paranoid i believed i wa being mocked by co worker behind my back or that stranger on the street and even people i had not seen in year somehow knew of my miserable existence this wa a feeling that i wa somehow not connecting to alcohol but the ocd and paranioa were too great to ignore sure enough i started reading online about long term mental affect and those two were at the top feeling of persecution and major anxiety were byproduct that i had been living with for too long and it started to anger me just how much time i had been living in such a deluded state over twenty year of drinking and i never once associated negative feeling with drinking this next phase wa what i would call a deep introspection that had me reflect on all of my past relationship and realize what an absolute madman i must have looked to ex my most glaring example being that i lived with an alcoholic and thought to myself holy shit wa that how i wa seen by my poor ex girlfriend no wonder half of them wont talk to me anymore between the drinking thrown in with a little narscissim i believed i wa practically entitled to treat them poorly all this reflection made me absolutely mortified of my past now i wanted nothing more than to contact the people i hurt an apologize because i honestly look back and i literally ca not believe i behaved a certain way to be honest it ha made me a sad person and to this day i struggle with addiction because of it sorry for the stream of nonsense i just felt a need to put it down my father died in december and between my drinking and resulting reflection it ha been a roller coaster of emotion with quitting my job moving back home and dealing with estate affair and i am just waiting for the storm to blow over already,alcoholism

24.74933,57.606407,how to reduce self shame social anxiety is real name by saying something unexpected isocial anxiety is an unnecessarily technical sounding term for what is in reality self shame something at some point in a person is life caused them to see people a a threat it permanently lowered their self esteem a person may feel guilty ashamed or embarrassed without knowing why but there is a distinct reason what we call anxiety is a defense mechanism at some point in life an individual with social anxiety experienced something that brought their esteem down they were made fun of in a crowd their so cheated on them they made a mistake and were publicly admonished ridiculed while they may have suppressed that experience or forgotten about it every time they are among others they retreat into a shell they do not want to make a mistake or be noticed a a precaution against repeating the negative experience the racing heartbeat inside turning heavy breath the sheer panic that voice in your head screaming no do not talk to that person do not speak up do not open yourself up for an attack you need to embrace that sensation and overpower it you cannot wait for it to stop and disappear before you start approaching and interacting with people because chance are it will not go away possibly ever though it may diminish significantly over time when your heart is beating so fast that the vein in your neck are making your eye pop and you feel you might suffocate from panic say something silly like but tree do not have any pocket or make a funny noise you will get a snicker and a few what lol and at that moment your brain should realize you are not in any real danger it may sound silly but here is the science behind it seeing a smile and hearing laughter is a physical signal that will be interpreted by your brain body a a sympathetic gesture and defuse the major fight or flight response your body is currently having more on this later to overcome self shame or anxiety you must realize the worst that can happen and then scale back to where you are and the worst that can happen in that specific situation worst case scenario type of consequence imagine you are in a crowded theater on national television with your gf bf and parent watching you say or do something and the theater erupts with laughter and sneer your significant other call you worthless and start making out with someone right then and there your face is all over national television at this point you need to put thing in perspective you are famous maybe for the wrong reason but people still know of you you are free to see other people million of people out there quite a few with a good heart remember friday by that girl everyone made fun of rebecca black can you imagine the anxiety she must have felt when faced with such an overwhelmingly negative reaction being an internet meme joke what you probably did not hear is that she kept making song and is now laughing all the way to the bank just kidding it is direct deposit but whatever your situation you are in ask yourself is this the worst that could happen the answer is almost always no the level of danger interpreted by your brain decrease then ask yourself even if it wa are the consequence unbearable and am i in real physical danger again the answer is usually no if yes call police and the level of panic should subside a bit more now remember the fight or flight response we talked about earlier that is rooted in the sympathetic v parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic system is fight or flight it nerve direct blood to the muscle and decrease blood supply to the gut it increase your heart rate and blood pressure this activates the body is immediate energy reserve to face the stressful state this is why people feel tired after a panic attack the parasympathetic system increase the blood supply to your digestive system and attempt to restore the body is energy reserve this is why i recommend saying something out of place by saying something out of place and silly you catch others off guard when a person is concentrated on something anything their brain is processing information relevant to that topic if it encounter information that ha absolutely nothing to do with the subject it trigger involuntary physical reaction creasing of the brow a slight smile a turning of the head for a moment it the brain doe not know what to do and neither doe the body this strategy is more for you the person with anxiety than for those around you when people are self absorbed in a story or an activity they do not exhibit sympathetic response they smile and nod le and if they do it is probably directed at someone else not you what you want to do is get people to exhibit friendly gesture specifically directed at you please do not confuse this strategy with wanting to direct all attention to you or anything like that this tactic simply trick people into exhibiting friendly i am not a threat gesture they may have otherwise forgotten about so that your brain can receive the all clear signal and relax people with high self esteem and confidence do not have self shame they do not see people a a threat and a such are neither looking for nor exhibiting sympathetic physical gesture they already feel at ease in their environment that may work for them but for people with self shame social anxiety who do see people a a threat need those physical indicator to reduce their anxiety here is why i do not recommend telling joke outright it is too much work for your already overloaded brain you are having a panic attack this is not the right time to worry about delivery and punchlines just blurting something silly out without thinking is far easier and more effective it is immediate so to recap ask yourself is this the worst case scenario answer no panic decrease ask yourself if it wa is it critical am i in danger answer no panic decrease blurt out something silly observe sympathetic response panic decrease again and should be at a manageable level you could also try initiating dialogue immediately after an anxiety episode remember that that is when your body is tired and probably doe not have the energy for more panic hope this help ad in response to some question and comment i have received in the past someone mentioned that pride stop them from blurting something random out pride is usually the manifestation of hidden shame or the relief that shame ha been avoided when people think a certain act will damage their pride dignity they are really saying that doing the act will bring with it the unpleasant feeling of shame or embarrassment in this case pride is the shield that protects the mind from being exposed to negative emotion on the other hand when one feel pride from accomplishing something they are feeling the relief of tension had they failed they would have felt shame they succeeded and avoided shame and instead are receiving praise the brain is thus feeling a relief of tension from the possibility of feeling shame pride often ha negative connotation in religious text because it is closely related or lead to arrogance and we can think of that a the belief that one cannot be shamed thus contradicting doctrine by placing the individual above god which society at the time did not approve someone mentioned that sneezing or saying something out of place increase their anxiety i would venture a guess that when people say something out of place the tension in the room increase and so doe their anxiety because people do not exhibit sympathetic signal yet their attention is focused on you this article on the feeling on being watched is a good read it explains that we are hardwired to know when we are being watched i interpret this a a survival mechanism you are trying to identify friend and foe now in modern society we have certain social norm you ca not fight foe and it is pretty awkward to flee a one would have in pre historic time this make your brain freak out even more because not only doe it feel threatened but because of education and upbringing it doe not see a viable response a way out you ca not scream fight run etc all you can do is sit and so the panic increase a sneeze turn others attention on him her and anxiety increase a sneeze is a sudden burst of sound and people instinctively glance to id the source a a possible threat when their brain catch up to the fact that it is just a sneeze they go back to what they are doing but and this is important that sudden sneeze that is out of place doe not lead people to exhibit sympathetic signal quite the opposite they exhibit hostile or guarded signal because for a split second they do not know the source or intention of the violent noise disturbance the key to saying doing something out of place to reduce anxiety is the following it must not be a surprise saying tree do not have pocket in a conversation about politics is odd maybe humorous but not surprising it is a conversation so people already expect you to say something just not that it must force natural sympathetic signal from people maybe the conversation is too serious or the people in it too istuck up for a joke or random saying to diffuse tension you have to evaluate the situation and choose the right thing to say do to force natural friendly signal to emerge smile laughter a nod a giggle a smirk a nod of the head a pat on the back a fist bump applause etc having a close friend you know well and who know about your anxiety with you in these situation is very helpful on the comment about the connection between toxic shame and self shame imo they are very different thing while i agree that self shame is toxic unhealthy toxic shame is the inherent belief that one is bad unworthy take the author of this post for instance i believe this author to be very wrong for several reason he argues that this deeply held belief usually take root in childhood and is the cause of anxiety i believe he is confusing cause and effect a the old saying go correlation doe not imply causation shame is not the cause of anxiety it is an effect the result of a traumatic past event people do not feel anxiety because they are ashamed they feel anxiety because in their past an event caused them to feel negative emotion what the author refers to a toxic shame is the manifestation of those symptom the person is anxious and ashamed because of their traumatic past take this simple analogy for example john is wife cheated on him john feel embarrassed and ashamed john is afraid to be in another relationship author say john is afraid of commitment because he feel embarrassed and ashamed author say john is afraid of commitment because his wife cheated on him which author is correct author because he dug to the root cause of john is emotional problem the event that led to his shame and anxiety you must realize that people are in many way the same a you they have at some point experienced the same emotion and asked themselves the same question do my friend like me are my peer judging me etc they might seem more calm and at ease but they are no le human emotion are universal use this a a common ground and to remind you that people have their own worry and goal,anxiety

7.5032854,73.975586,how do people get in romantic relationship probably more rambling i do not get how people end up in romantic relationship i know that the language that i am using right now implies that thing just fall into place without effort i understand that from the outside it may look like that but obviously there is some effort and stuff that happens to foster the relationship sometimes married people fondly refer to the first time they met and have a story for it i mean it never go into the detail of like i awkwardly brought up a topic about and then apparently s he wa interested in it and we then had a good conversation about it and then i wanted to meet up again so the lack of information from hearing other people is story is not helpful at least imo another thing i am concerned about is that in order to have a better chance you need to be in the right context to ask someone out talking to someone that you see on the bus is not really a good context because there is no common interest sure you both are taking the bus in common but that is not an interest so those attempt usually end up not going anywhere romantically surely for just conversation to pas the time is ok people say to join group or club or whatnot i feel like those are better for making friend and it is just a positive extra if you find someone mutually romantically interested in it is a better context especially if you are not just looking for a fling but i feel like it would burn bridge if thing do not work out then there is the context of party which is also a good context depending on the nature of the party it can be for fling or for more stable relationship but i really do not get how people mutually like each other romantically i mean sure there are those tip on flirting or whatever but i always find it in a way paradoxical like the le you care about getting into a relationship the more likely you are to get into one but at the same time you have to bullshit and say have not i seen you before or say something that is not directly related to romantic thing because it would come across a too aggressive stating romantic or sexual statement maybe i have been too scared to say something like i like your shirt or something because i still find that too direct and then i always think of the stupid mistake that i did when trying to interact with a crush especially thinking like ugh what i did contributed to the inequality against woman and my action were supportive of sexism in an implicit manner and i feel guilty for doing so i have been pretty dumb in the past like buying a birthday gift pretty much in all case i could only ask online i do not know i just feel socially incapable of interacting in person either way i feel like i burned bridge with those people and then there is the possibility of toxic relationship what if this other person is trying to take advantage of me how do i know this person really love me or they have another motive then there is those dramatic show where one spouse poison the other spouse to get their life insurance money or something but in milder case how do i know this person is not toxic or will not be and then there is the question of am i the toxic one so then i feel like i will need to work on myself to improve my behavior and reaction which is another thing mentioned a a tip but i feel like to even approach a marginally decent person it would take a long time and i would not ever get into a relationship by then anyway i mean i guess there is online dating but i hear that those are so bad especially if you are a minority i do not know i mean it would be nice to be in a relationship with someone who is mutually loving but i feel like it is hard to interpret the other person,anxiety

change where we have to find a new place state to live within week depending on what is offered or move back to old city i lived in for year and my anxiety is at an all time high nbsp history single parent home one sibling my sibling and i got along fine but my mother wa abusive verbally and physically for a long a i can remember she would hit me for extended period of time with anything conveniently in reach whenever i pissed her off talking back not doing chore properly not helping her quickly enough this went on until i wa and she met a rich guy who she thought she wa going to marry and live a nice life with at this point my sibling who is year older had taken a vacation at my paternal grandmother is home and two week in called to tell my mother they wa staying with her permanently i wa alone with my mother mother asked me if i wanted to come with her move far away to live with her boyfriend and i said no that i wanted to stay in the city where i had grown up and gone to school she did not argue or resist mother wa quite young when she had me and my sibling and she seemed to resent having two child with a dead father quite a bit she would tell u how much of a financial burden we were and that my dad is grandparent never helped her i e money sent enough so mother found a friend of a friend young woman in her late is that she said would take me on a a roommate and left me with her one meeting after meeting her for the first time i lived in a makeshift room in that person is living room it wa a bedroom apartment one year later she called to tell me me money had run out and she could no longer let me live with her friend is friend she had at this point broken up with the rich boyfriend and urged me to live with her she had moved in with my grandparent far away because she had no money i said no and asked her if she could just come back so we could have a home together again she screamed abuse at me and told me i wa being my usual horrible terrible self and that if i did not do what she wanted she did not care where i ended up i ended up emancipated i lived with some of my friend for the last two and a half year of high school month at a time when i tried not to wear out my welcome their parent were very nice and to this day i am forever grateful that they took in a random stranger kid and fed me and gave me a bed for so long my high school counselor found a job in the high school counseling office that gave me a week so i could buy food for lunch and dinner i did not like always eating at my friend because i already felt like a burden i lived on slice pizza deal and egg and ramen i got good grade in high school and got enough financial aid a an emancipated minor to go to a university from then i worked a much a i could to make it back up out of being poor to this day i have an overwhelming fear and paranoia of becoming poor and homeless again whenever any relative to now small thing such a having to spend a couple hundred dollar on an unexpected repair or medical issue pop up i get a massive anxiety episode that last for day or week even though we have enough saving and income so that even a few thousand dollar of expense would be easily taken care of i still live in fear of losing everything back to the point where i wa and homeless i did not talk to my mother for over year i talk to her now but try to keep the contact minimal i see her once or twice a year on holiday my friend and partner sometimes tell me i should just not talk to her because she ha not changed but at her older age i feel pity for her she is poor never wa good with working a steady job or saving everyone in the family think she ha mental health issue and barely able to make end meet so i try to maintain a minimal relationship so i do not feel like i am abandoning her nbsp just in case it is a question i do have other aunt and uncle relative but year later i found out that they thought my mother wa taking care of me remotely because they would ask about me and she would lie and tell them i wa doing fine even though we were not on speaking term i thought for year that they just did not care nbsp conclusion question given that this anxiety appeared after moving across the country could it be possible that it will disappear if we move back job circumstance are such that we are being requested to move back by my partner is company i am not happy in the new city we live in so i would be happier moving back where it feel safe and familiar it ha been suggested to me by my sibling friend and partner that i should get on anti anxiety medicine like lexapro because they can see my anxiety is crippling my everyday life how hard is it to get off lexapro i am afraid of having to be on it for the rest of my life can i overcome this anxiety without medication by talking to a counselor psychologist i know i have abandonment abuse trauma issue which i thought i had overcome via counseling after college but now i feel like i have circled back to the same emotional state i wa in before thank you for reading,anxiety

-19.606552,95.97461,is blaming unhealthy getting my thought in order and telling my story this is an attempt at putting my thought down making sense of them giving them structure and telling my story i find it all overwhelming nbsp i moved away from the city because i wa sad finding life difficult and although i had a boyfriend who loved me and tried to take the best care of me a he could i would throw it back in his face a it frustrated me that he couldn t understand how i felt nbsp the relationship wa at it s end when i left though the dependency wa still there and we kept it going we were done and he wa moving away from me i still needed him a he wa my only constant and that wa taken away even after a year cognitive behavioural therapy i still blame myself they say i shouldn t because it wasn t my fault but i am afraid that it wa i cannot even hate him which make me feel weak nbsp i live in my hometown i moved away from here so often in search of something else i now realise that i am the same everywhere i go but staying in my hometown is such a drain i just want to disappear not see anyone i know yet i yearn for close bond with individual that can never be sustained because what i feel when it come down to it is i am either too much or not enough for people to want to be near me or need me nbsp i now realise a lot of my issue with all relationship stem from traumatic experience sustained in my childhood my father wa violent the first memory i have of this behaviour wa with my sister we clawed and clung to each other a we watched the shadow of our mother being beaten by our father on the staircase i must have been no older than four this is distressing to recollect nbsp while undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy it became apparent that i had blocked thing which had happened to me and remembered those which happened to my sister those thing did come back in bit and piece he wa annoyed because she had left some sweetie wrapper on the sofa he dragged her through by her hair and violently pulled her hair back and pushed it into the sofa where the rubbish lay and and she lay crumpled on the sofa he punched her in the face and a a last note of dignity he spat on her i hid behind the chair next to the radiator she would have been no more than nine year old nbsp i had to get rushed to the hospital because they thought he d broken my arm i wa refusing to go to bed and settle down and my father dragged me at the same time a closing the door on me i wa four nbsp he wa generally twat any other time he wa vicious with his word and never had anything good to say none of u ever did good enough except my brother because he wa a boy the boy get treated differently on my father side of the family no photo of either me or my sister sit in the house and in my father office there are two photo of his previous dog and two of my brother i love my brother i love my mother my sister is a mess who is selfish and will never address the thing which happened to her nbsp i have my father temper explosive due to all those year i wa upset the day before my fifteenth birthday a mix of a lifetime of erratic behaviour caused me to self harm at the peak of my mental frustration i would punch myself and hit myself repeatedly against wall full pelt he punched me square in the face a i launched my elbow into a wall i wa flung into my bedroom to deal with my bleeding swollen face nbsp i now know the anger go deep there wa no self soothing when i wa a child and i am only just learning to do so now i am almost thirty i feel unloved lonely and yearn for love but don t feel people ever mean it when they say it i don t trust when people say i am good at thing or when i am beautiful or that i can sing or that i can do anything if i wanted to my father anger ha a voice and it rot my soul nbsp when i wa nineteen a man followed me on my journey home and tried to rape me i fought him off my father told me i should be thankful i wa use to fighting and my aunt said i must be at least mildly attractive for someone to want to do that he wa caught and he went to prison he wa released eighteen month later and lived around the corner from me having moved back to my hometown i see him regularly he once asked me the time i should have stabbed him in the face with my key and sliced off his tongue with the serrated edge but i just kept walking nbsp when i moved back from the city i got a job working with my parent and it didn t go well when my partner and i broke up it wa devastating i had just started my therapy the first few session of which he attended with me i remember being so proud to have him there with me nbsp two week after the third session he became distant he wa working six day so it wa harder to see him and talk to him and he stopped replying to my text a often i started to despair and drink phoning him and cry in uttermost turmoil on one occasion i queried a to his whereabouts and he said he wa at the flat in the close outside so i told him to go in and he changed his story he wa at paul s paul wa crashed out though after the night drinking and he d leave soon i knew he wa lying and screamed down the phone and he hung up he phoned back and i apologised rhythmically i m sorry i m sorry the sound wa like that of a child it s my fault i m sorry i wa matching the rhythm with my fingernail in the carpet rocking back and forth i m sorry this is what he needed to get rid of me he didn t want it anymore i didn t blame him and still don t he wa at her s nbsp my work carried on a normal and although i went out and wa drinking i wa at work on time and working although void of much emotion my father unable to deal with any emotion wrote me a letter one morning this wa one week after my and my partner had broken up nbsp dear word cannot express my real disappointment at your attitude and approach to your employment with ourselves i accept there are extenuating circumstance but any other employer would not permit these a excuse for your general attitude you have to ask yourself do i want a place of my own if the answer is yes then you have got to knuckle down we can no longer accept your performance at the moment so this letter is by way of a final written warning nbsp i had just been diagnosed with depression and suffering from a breakup within the month i ve not spoken to him since june last year and a far a i am concerned i have no real father figure in my life no one to be proud of he is a much a a disappointment to me a i am so evidently to him nbsp so now i m miserable and lonely and spend most of my time blaming him for my shortcoming in life i try to avoid it to switch it off but i cannot i want to avoid the melodrama but i don t see myself making it through a down time sometimes nbsp there wa a girl found in the forest having taken her own life i have imagined this scenario and find it most calming i imagine settling down next to a tree on some soft grass watching the canape sway and listening to the brush of leaf while bird sing to each other i imagine taking that last breath and feeling my energy finally pacify and disperse among the vegetation,depression

22.320005,100.243866,going through depression please help hi so just to start off i am year old and am in college i have been dating this girl for over a year now and we have definitely had our ups and down i met her when she had a bad break up and wa going through suicidal thought and heavy depression we met through a mutual organization and she wa very open about her depression but everything else clicked well and we started dating i knew she wa too attached to me but i wa glad to always be there for her she would cry almost every night from her depression and i would stay up late every often comforting her in any way possible she wa not able to even sleep in her own dorm room and she would always come to my apartment and i would let her come without hesitating knowing she went through a lot however we were both doing well together and liked each other a lot although her anxiety and depression still hit her she smiled a lot more often and i wa satisfied becoming more open to new friendship along the way summer came about month into the relationship and basically i woke up late every day because i did not have too much to do and she would wake up early because her parent forced her to she wa depressed for a while realizing that i wa the only person she could talk to i started taking her for granted a little bit because i knew she would text me whenever however we had started having some fight and i think it wa mainly a result of the distance and nothing to really talk about but i soon realized that i had become too attached to her in the process she realized that she had to fix herself and keep herself busy from being too lonely and started becoming a lot more involved the organization she wa part of and starting to shift away from me after the first week of school started again she started realizing that she did not have a many feeling for me a she did especially when she realized how i attached i wa to her she apparently wa trying to convince herself that it wa the summer time that we didn t spend together but she knew it wasn t that she then started talking to another person who she had apparently been talking to right before we broke up and basically got with him right before we broke up and it devastated me i cried drank myself to sleep a few time knowing that it wa unhealthy however i kept trying to get back into her life and we started talking more again she ended up cheating on him with me for a while and eventually she broke up with him in just a month after she noticed some red flag early in their relationship and got back with me because she still had feeling for me we have been dating for another month since that time and it ha been a lot better for the both of u we even told our parent about each other since we consider this a pretty serious relationship but while she ha definitely improved her mental health i feel that me and her have switched role i get very depressed alone and find it hard to keep myself busy my head hurt and i occasionally cry alone i feel myself getting attached to her again and it is because of all of my insecurity lately this past week she ha rarely been texting me because she ha been too busy and i feel so lonely i try not to show her my insecurity because i am not the type to open up on that kind of stuff often i know this isn t her fault and i don t know what to do i regret dating a depressed girl like this sometimes a soon a she got better she didn t care to check up on me ever because she assumed i m always okay even when we text i have to keep the conversation going by asking about what she s doing and what she s interested in she loses interest often when i talk about something that i m interested in i really sometimes feel like breaking up with her but i do love her a lot i think my greatest fear is being lonely since these past few month i did not talk to my friend that often and stuck with her while she ha been more open in term of hanging out with other people aside from just me also after the whole cheating incident i am insecure on the fact that she will do it to me again i am not sure what to do if anyone ha an opinion on my situation please share i know i do have a fault in this and i just want to know what s the best option to become more mentally healthy with the coronavirus i m basically at home with no one to talk to and it ha been hitting me hard mentally,depression

18.485216,-26.832415,i could really use some motivation hi i am christine i have been battling depression since elementary school and am now in college and it doe not seem to be letting up all that often motivation is something that i have always lacked i have so many dream but there is so many thing stopping me i feel like some thing i really want to do are make an album for my college capstone learn to dance better and make more dance cover make more youtube video in general build a gaming computer live healthier there is a lot more obviously that i would love to do but this is more what i am wanting to do right now working toward however here is what i believe is stopping me from achieving these thing making an album is a long term project and i know that it is going to take forever i just do not have the resource at the current moment to actually learn and better myself in producing music singing all i have been doing a of recent is writing lyric but that is all i feel that i can do for now learning to dance is hard when your family ca not afford dance lesson i love dancing and want to do it more but i have no room at home with my mom remodeling the entire downstairs there is no room upstairs a most of the stuff from downstairs had to be bought upstairs and spread across the room i ca not dance outside because it stay in the s from noon until pm i want to make more youtube video like i used to i used to upload weekly but when it come to thinking about editing it i feel le motivated to because my laptop is not working a well a it used to and it make editing a big stressful hassle i know it may seem silly but once you have been making video for a long a i have and your editor crash every minute while editing and then crash an export time before actually getting the video exported you will understand what i mean point is one of the reason why i want to build a gaming computer unfortunately they are very expensive to build especially what i will need one for i plan to build a computer for video editing gaming streaming photography editing and graphic design since i cannot work over the summer however and my side business ha been slow my income ha been hit quite hard the reasoning for not being able to work over the summer is that i am taking the summer to really work on my health because it is lacking a lot i wa diagnosed with pcos which doe not have a cure my body ha taken a hard it so i have been trying to change my diet and exercise more but my mom is not making it easy for me she doe not want to spend the money on healthy food and doe not see my diagnosis a a big deal i also have been trying to exercise more but my mom doe not see a point me me doing so and idk why it is really discouraging because i am trying to be healthier for my benefit and she is taking every chance she can get to bring me down a she is very verbally abusive i know it is a lot and may seem stupid to some but it is something that i have been dealing with for year i just do not really know how to beat this funk that it ha put me in and overcome it the diagnosis hit me hard because it could have been prevented had we gone in sooner but my mom waited month to take me in to get checked because i had completely stopped having my period it got to the point where my dad got so mad that he almost took me himself and he normally doe not accompany me to doctor appointment because he like to give me space i know a lot of my depression and anxiety stem from my mom but it is so hard to deal with her while also trying to live my life out better when she is there bashing me for everything i do i just could really use some motivation do what i want to do and persevere because i have a very dry bank account at the moment due to all the medical expense lately i do not want to give up but i feel like doing so because i do not see what else to do,depression

20.648798,-29.537424,i am ready to end my life i do not know what else to do anymore i am in my mid s single and never married no kid unemployed stuck in the middle of nowhere living with my toxic narcissistic mother i have been suffering from depression for month and when i try to open up or talk about it people say i am making excuse and not trying hard enough i keep trying to find a job and getting nowhere i have been to so many interview only to suffer the old bait and switch all my experience is the restaurant business a a dishwasher busboy and a waiter i keep applying for restaurant job that advertise how they need dishwasher and prep cook or busboy during the day but when i interview it is for a line cook position at night i ca not do that job i have tried on several occasion and i just ca not do it i am not good at it and i do not like doing it but for some reason it seems to be all i can find and i hate this weird stereotype that if you want a career in a restaurant you have to cook there are other job in a restaurant besides cooking it doe not help matter that i need daytime hour the reason being that i live in the country the nearest town is about mile away i do not have a driver is license because no one want to help me get it i have held a learner is permit for almost a year and i have next to no driving experience and no one want to help me get that experience or help me learn to drive my only chance of getting a job is find one in town in order to make that work i either have to have transportation to and from or live in town so i can ride my bike there i ca not ride my bike into town everyday because the highway between here and there is a death trap of steep hill blind curve and redneck driver who will not share the road with someone on a bike the few time i have tried it were not only exhausting but i wa nearly killed several time by driver who have no tolerance for a bicycle on the highway staying in town mean being homeless and shelter lock their door at around pm any night time job mean not getting off work until pm at the earliest and the shelter do not make exception regardless of your circumstance they just ask ca not you switch to day umm no i ca not the only hour they had available were night if i had transportation or a place in town i could make it work but i do not have either of those thing which mean not having anywhere to go when i get off work trying to find someone to take me back and forth mean finding someone willing to drive mile a day to get me to work then they drive back to go home then another to come get me and then to bring me home the average vehicle get about mile to the gallon and gas is about a gallon so right off the bat it is a day in gas plus at least another for the trouble of driving me that is a day in transportation cost and my average pay is about an hour which mean about half my pay is going just to transportation the only reason i have been able to make it to interview is by getting up early and literally hitchhiking to town they are usually in the afternoon and everybody head to their work in town early a pm interview for me mean getting up at am putting interview clothes and hygiene supply in my backpack hitching a ride and then changing and freshening up at the public library bathroom then when it is over i try and hitch back i usually get home by pm so i get up at am and get home around pm just to make it to a pm job interview that last minute top then there is my train wreck of a mother it is always something with her i have been homeless on the street in the middle of winter trying to work a full time job and she is constantly calling me whining about how she doe not have x or is out of y and she is worried about z and sobbing crocodile tear about how nobody care and i am the only one who can help her and i always do which is why i remain homeless because i do not make much money but mom desperately need whatever i have just so she can turn around the next week and cozy up to her on again off again boyfriend and mooch off of him but then for some reason the next week my pay week she is on the out with him and once again i am the only one who care and can help she is an alcoholic who keep going back and forth with her abusive boyfriend i have had several good restaurant job in the past but they were place that had bar in them and she make a habit of turning my work into her hangout and get drunk spot then she constantly make a scene while she is drunk and smart off about how her son work there and she can do whatever she want which lead to me getting fired the unfortunate nick name norman bates ha followed me from several job she doe not have a license or vehicle so she ca not help me and even if she did have she would not could not help me because of her drinking sometimes she is here at the house most of the time she is at her boyfriend is he will not help me he is the typical redneck conservative who feel like i should already have a license and it is my own fault for not being able to get one without any help from anyone even though it is literally impossible to get a driver is license completely on your own so i am stuck at the house by myself most of the time food is sparse and usually what i get is cheap and processed mostly canned and frozen my health ha been declining a a result of the poor diet that ha been forced upon me canned veggie are not a good for you a fresh the only reason i have food is because when i hitch hike to town i visit the local food pantry once in a while mom throw me to get food up here at the nearby dollar store it is a mile hike there and back there is electricity and water here only because my mom pay them for her disability record she ha to maintain her own residence to keep getting her disability so she us this place for that purpose even though for all intent and purpose she life with her boyfriend who make thousand a an independent electrical contractor and owns a house on acre and ha half a dozen vehicle at his disposal he drink all the time and is verbally and physically abusive to my mom who put up with it because he literally throw hundred of dollar at her when he get drunk and even though my mom is only here part time i ca not treat this place like it is mine there is only one bedroom in this trailer and i ca not use it i sleep on a comforter on the floor of the living room when she is here i have no privacy and i ca not do anything she sits at the kitchen table all day on facebook worrying about what everyone else is doing and commenting on it if i try to watch something or play a video game i ca not have the sound on unless i wear headphone and i ca not wear headphone because she will keep trying to talk to me about the dumb b she find on facebook while i have them on and she get pissed because i ca not hear her so when she is here i basically have to sit and do nothing but wait to respond to her i just do not know what to do anymore i ca not seem to find a day job to literally save my life everyday i get more and more depressed and hopeless and endlessly bored nothing interest me anymore not video game or movie or anything on netflix or youtube i endlessly scroll reddit all day everyday seeing the same post over and over i am always putting in job application through craigslist and indeed i ca not get professional help with my depression and adhd symptom because i do not have any kind of insurance and i am broke i have no family nearby that i can turn to except for the drunk mother i want to go back to town and be homeless but employed i have done it before and thrived until my mother enters the picture i want to go back to town and get away from all of this shit but i ca not unless i have a job that is the only missing ingredient is a job i do not even care about the hour because i have a tent i can find a hiding spot in some wood outside town and ride my bike to and from i can talk to management about barring my mother from patronizing the place where i work but it ha to be a job i can do and i ca not work the line i tried i wa terrible maybe if i had the right training and had more experience i could do it i do not know i feel like i am stuck and i am completely isolated which is not helping anything maybe i just have to go back to town without a job lined up and do my best i ca not take much more of this i have already tied a noose just in case i just feel better having it around it is my escape hatch honestly the only reason i have not used it yet or just bailed and gone to town is because she left her cat behind here with me i care more about the cat than i do her because if it were not for the cat i would be completely alone,depression

12.128968,32.278824,feel like i tried anything would like some advice on moving forward hi guy i am experiencing chronic severe depression and severe anxiety a a part of my borderline personality disorder bpd this is what i have been told by my current psychiatrist of almost a year i truly feel like i have tried everything to shake these constant thought and feeling of immense grief sadness and suicide that seem to permeate into every minute of my life and every facet of my being the reason i am posting now is because i am currently feeling the worst i have ever felt and feel extremely close to killing myself i wa first diagnosed with anxiety and depression a a year old and i am now a year old i feel like i should note that i have felt depressed and out of place since i wa a young boy and a a result spent a lot of time by myself doing thing like playing nintendo or browsing the internet which i wa berated for for year by my parent and brother this made me very scared of them and made me want to spend more time alone resulting in more berating and eventually physical abuse from my brother and father they hate the fact i do not seem to mesh with their way of living and want to spend so much time addicted to information or addicted to video game but i feel a though this drove me further inward like a snowball of sort i wa started on fluoxetine prozac at that age but it seemed to numb my feeling towards everything kill my appetite for food video game sexual release and really anything that make a human human after almost a year of prozac i decided to take the advice of a friend and request to be taken off it so that i could try lsd and see if that helped a i had read a lot that it ha a way of changing the perspective of individual massively which is what i really felt that i needed ultimately he ended up falling through and i realised that he wa not really my friend a he really did not want to talk to me anymore after he realised how socially awkward i wa in real life i ended up with chronic fatigue syndrome in my senior year of high school after having insomnia for a few year of high school usually only hour sleep per night which resulted in me sleeping hour per day and failing all my senior year subject i wa urged to repeat my senior year but i refused from sheer embarrassment i would have killed myself then and there if people realised how truly pathetic i wa that i wa so retarded that i could not sleep and wa so depressed that i could not find the will or energy to study or do anything really the year following my high school year i entered into vocational education for information technology i did not do any recreational or medicinal drug this year but i slept a lot played a lot of game at least hour of dota and rarely went to school i still managed to pas everything and get a pathway to a bachelor of computer science however i had a very bad panic attack one of many way my anxiety manifest myself during an end of year test and wa urged to see a psychologist a i had stopped seeing my high school psychiatrist at the beginning of i entered into my university degree and saw a new psychologist who told me that i should definitely see a psychiatrist a she think i need medication a well a cognitive behavioural therapy cbt to manage my issue i will indicate my prescription in small list below to make it easier to read i went and saw a psychiatrist and wa prescribed mg diazepam valium daily mg quetiapine seroquel daily this helped for a while but it started to lose it is effect and so i wa eventually prescribed mg diazepam valium daily mg lorazepam ativan daily mg temazepam restoril daily mg quetiapine seroquel daily over time i seemed to need more and more benzodiazepine to achieve the same effect a with the anti psychotic i wa rotated through a series of anti psychotic including quetiapine listed above ziprasidone olanzapine the anti psychotic seemed to diminish in effect and i wa urged to take way higher dos but i read this is like giving yourself a chemical lobotomy so i refused i ended up coming off benzodiazepine to see if the change in tolerance after resuming them and moderating my use more would help but i have ended up in the same place a well a using alcohol to cope on a day to day basis with my feeling of suicide i feel like i am now at a crossroad between killing myself or going on large amount of anti depressant and anti psychotic a advised by my psychiatrist which i really do not want to do because i would feel a though i lost what little part of myself i currently have i have even ended up trying lsd and higher dos of ketamine a i read they have been successfully experimented with treatment resistant depression but that only helped for a few day or a week before i resumed my regular awfully painful thinking please could anybody indicate some other option that large amount of sedative anti depressant and anti psychotic,depression

102.102974,-10.38259,i think i might be depressed input loooong read this is a hardcore vent ok so a the title said i am kind of trying to figure out whether or not how i feel is normal or if i should be seeking some kind of help it would be great if people who actually know about depression either from being diagnosed with it or just having some kind of experience with it could give me some input a to whether or not i might need to do something about this anyway here is the situation arranged by general topic i wish i wa dead or better yet had never been born i have felt this way for a while the first time i can really remember feeling this way wa around the beginning of high school i mean sometimes on a nice sunny day when i am in a reasonably good mood i will think to myself i am actually kind of glad that i am alive today but the feeling pass before long the only time in the past several year that i can remember being truly happy wa when i wa with my then girlfriend but i am pretty sure that wa mostly because of the hormonal rush anyway this mentality kind of show up in some of the thing i say i often joke about death and do not take it very seriously not because i do not find the idea of dying to be intimidating but because i view it a a respite i feel like life is kind of a dumb game that i got forced to play and really do not see the point of from how other people talk about and treat death i gather that this is not a normal way of viewing thing now before going on i should clarify that i am not suicidal because suicide is against my belief and frankly i am not sure i could pull the trigger even if i decided to i have never attempted suicide and i do not plan on it although i have thought about it before not thought about it a in considered doing it but more like fantasized about it if that make sense i am a year old male in college and i just do not feel like the future look promising i am a pretty smart guy that is really the only big asset i have honestly because i am not outgoing or athletic or handsome or even a particularly pleasant person to be around once you know me i make great grade in school but i have no idea what to do with my life i do not know what i want to do for a career and i am getting to the point where i ca not afford to be indecisive anymore i feel like i could get somewhere if i could just get pointed in the right direction but right now i am just treading water in a dull and fairly common major that i have no passion for but at the very least ha some decent job utility i am thinking of going to law school after i graduate almost everyone i know swears i would be a great lawyer but i do not know if i will be able to afford it or even if it is a good idea i have not had any job yet ever and that is causing problem in multiple area first off my parent have obviously been trying to get me to get a job for the past few summer at first i just did not want to and that wa kind of ok because i wa still young enough that it wa not a huge issue and i did not really need the money my college cost are covered mostly by scholarship and the rest is paid by my family my parent make a decent income and they view it a their responsibility to pay for the education of their child and yes i do realize how lucky i am to have parent that do that for me but obviously a year old who is never been employed is not attractive on paper so every passing year i become le employable add this to my social awkwardness and you have got a recipe for unemployment i could not get a summer job the past summer and now my mother ha told me that i am not allowed home this summer until i have gotten a job a fair move on her part i do not resent it the problem is that i go to school out of state so i ca not really get a job at home without actually being there to get it so i am kind of freaking out about the fact that i may very well be homeless this summer if i do not work something out maybe it would be good for me who know anyway there is the pressure from home about the job but there is also the pressure of my finance i have had enough money saved up to cover random college cost going out with my friend for pizza or whatever up until now but that is starting to run out then there is the pressure of my own self esteem for quite a while i did not really understand when people talked about how a man is occupation is really a big deal for his self esteem now i do being a jobless parent leech ha had a much bigger impact on my self esteem than i ever could have guessed so i feel like shit for that my university ha a great employment network internship and the like that i could really use to my advantage but since i do not actually know where i am trying to go with a career internship are kind of pointless until i figure out what the fuck i am doing oh and while we are on the topic of job in addition to feeling very pessimistic about my chance of being able to land a job in the first place i also feel really pessimistic about my ability to perform well in whatever job i get i mean i am academically smart but in the real world i am an idiot i have no common sense at all i feel like if i did get a job i would just make so many stupid mistake and be so worthless a a thinking employee that i would be fired basically i do not consider myself a skilled or competent person also i do not do well under pressure so any kind of job with high risk for messing up is just a recipe for disaster a i would panic from the risk mess up and the world would explode moving on girlfriend a i said i have had one serious relationship so far in my life it wa a year long long distance relationship and during that relationship i learned a ton about myself the biggest thing that i learned wa that i am a shitty boyfriend i wa absurdly controlling over protective and paranoid i suspect that the distance gap had something to do with that and i know that my own insecurity had a huge role in it i am not trying to make excuse i hold myself responsible for my action but i am pretty sure that i would have been a lot better if i genuinely believed i wa worth her love anyway that relationship eventually ended in a mutual breakup although after we broke up thing went a bit south but that is not too relevant so i am not going into it i know that in many way i wa a really awesome boyfriend but like i said i wa insanely controlling and protective and my strength in other area really do not compensate for that so i do not feel very confident in my partner value this feeling is compounded by my lack of job a described previously and my lack of any real plan for the future the thing is i really want someone to go through life with but i really do not feel it would be fair of me to get involved with someone in my current state like emotionally i really want a relationship but mentally i do not i do not have the money to get into that right now and i just do not feel like i have my act together enough a a person once i have a job and some form of career plan and have worked through my own personal flaw some form of mental emotional issue being among them i suspect then i will seek out a relationship but until then no the problem is that i do not see myself getting to the point a a person where i feel ready for a relationship any time soon and that make me really sad i mean especially in college i see everyone around me being happy with their so and it break my heart knowing i ca not have that i genuinely believe i could get a girlfriend if i tried but again i just do not think it would be right to get involved with a girl knowing that i am not even close to being to the point where i would be ready for a serious long term relationship but that lack of girlfriend is just another straw on the camel is back and that camel is starting to look mighty strained friend i would say i have friend here at school many more at home but that is not that meaningful since i am away from them of the year with a big enough distance gap that i ca not visit we spend a lot of time together and i am thankful to have them my freshman year i literally sat in my room by myself almost all day every day even my roommate who i get along reasonably well with wa gone most of the time and that wa possibly the most miserable year of my life i am not someone that like to have a lot of friend i prefer a few close friend to a lot but having literally no friend that year wa absolute hell the problem with my friend though is that they are kind of asshole we are all kind of asshole to each other that is just how it is with a group of guy but i feel like this go a bit beyond the norm any time someone in the group say something that is even slightly wrong or against the opinion of the rest a piranha like frenzy occurs and they are verbally beaten down to a pulp this happens to everyone in the group not just me basically we are very unforgiving of any kind of stupidity or wrong ness we are all pretty smart guy now that is all reasonably forgivable because we all do it to each other and it is never really taken too personally but the thing is the older brother of the friend i hang out with the most who also go to our university and is therefore around a lot is a major asshole literally of everything i say he will either directly mock or argue about him and my friend are very close so whenever i disagree with either of them the other will immediately jump in so while my friend is fun to be around when his brother is not there they both become an asshole tag team when they are together and this is only with me they rarely pick on anyone else which is why with this guy the older brother who mock me at every chance and is then joined by his brother my friend i take it personally now i assume the reasonable thing to say here is i should just find new friend that do not treat me like shit the thing is i am a pretty shy guy i do not make friend easily so the last thing i want to do is ditch these guy and end up back where i started with no friend at all i do not really have any hobby to speak of aside from reddit duh and a few online game while this is not directly a bad thing i am never bored it doe make me kind of a dull person finally i have a variety of fun character flaw that i do not like about myself i am very whiny the irony of saying that in a post on r depression is not lost on me i am lazy i have a hard time motivating myself to do anything i occasionally get really arrogant about my intelligence i think this is me latching onto the one trait i like about myself because that is all i have got and i seem to have an addictive personality currently the only thing i would say i am addicted to is porn but that is a really big deal to me i feel like shit because of it it is against my belief and i just feel like dirt when i look at it i also consider it another detriment to my value a a spouse partner note that i am not trying to make anyone else feel judged or whatever your action are your business but it doe make a difference in how i view myself if nothing else i do not like that i do not have the strength to overcome my addiction i guess that basically sum up all the shit that weighs me down so the point of all this is that i just feel absolutely miserable about myself about my future about life itself some of these issue are more recent obviously but the general unhappiness ha been around for a while i walk around with a frown on my face all the time not even intentionally but just because my face seems to have adopted that a it default position on occasion i have had people walk up randomly and ask me what wa wrong because they thought i looked upset when nothing wa out of the ordinary like i said at the beginning i am just not happy to be here or anywhere so my question to everyone who is somehow made it through that monstrosity of a post is this am i just going through growing pain is this a normal way to feel at my age or do i need to think about seeking some kind of help i wa laying in bed cry the other night and i realized not sure why it took so long for this to occur to me that i may actually have some kind of emotional problem that need to be addressed after all i am pretty sure everyone around me doe not feel this way if they do they are doing a damn good job of hiding it anyway sorry for the seriously insane post you just read or maybe skimmed i do not blame you thanks so much for taking the time to read it and i really appreciate any input you guy have tl dr i wish i wa dead am i depressed seriously though since the point of this post is that i am asking if my thought attitude are somewhat normal because i might need to get help if they are not please do not try to give any advice if you wo not at least skim through and read what is going on i more than understand if you do not want to read it all but you ca not make an informed suggestion without actually having some idea of what is going on,depression

12.969433,102.210075,crushing the hope and dream of a friend is an awful terrible horrible thing please help when i wa a teenager in middle school i met a guy named boogie fake name obviously boogie wa a social outcast who wa obsessed with trading card game larping and fantasy trope he had a very kind soul though and a naive optimism that wa infectious if there is anyone i would compare him to it would be lenny from of mouse and men boogie and i were never exceptionally close mostly because we never had the same class together during the day see boogie wa a little slower than most kid and he wa in the special ed program i still saw him from time to time though and we always talked when we could fast forward to we both managed to graduate from high school i go off to college in a different city and boogie stay in our hometown after failing my class at the university due to anxiety and depression i return home feeling defeated and alone boogie hears about my return he give me a call and we start talking reminiscing about the past mostly we start humoring the idea of moving in together my parent have an awesome house though and i am not too eager to give it up for a shithole apartment i explain this to boogie and i promise to him that one day we will move out together surely boogie make a mental note of this and he even start to ascribe a mystical quality to the event naive and foolishly optimistic thought begin to cloud his mind eclipsing his better judgement he speaks to me about his vision for our future together we can have our own youtube channel he shriek through the earpiece we will make a million dollar just like pewdiepie and both of u can even have fancy car and all the videogames we want i let him have his fun even though i know that all of that stuff most likely would never happen if we moved in together i do not see the harm in humoring the idea for the next year and a half i attend a local community college i do poorly i lose all motivation to be in school and i start to daydream about leaving my shitty hometown and shitty college behind for a truly independent life free of institution and boss and manager etc i know it is foolish but my depression guide me to these outlandish and desperate thought i drop out of school my parent are devastated my mother tell me that she feel that she ha failed to raise me properly and that i am not the son she wanted to have now is the time i think to myself i have burnt the bridge and now it is time to start my new life from scratch this is what all of my complacency and self destructive tendency have been building towards i can be like eminem in that one song about when he hit rock bottom and then he became a famous rapper out of sheer determination those thought lasted for maybe a day turn out it doe not feel good to lose the support of your parent in fact it feel pretty fucking horrible i had not just lost their support financially but also emotionally a well they were too disappointed in me to comfort me or tell me that everything wa going to be alright the time for sentiment and gentle care wa over for the next few week argument and fight erupted almost every night in the house emotion were at a boiling point and it wa only a matter of time before my parent finally kicked me out for good during this time i spoke with boogie regularly detailing what wa going on and stressing the importance of u moving out together soon boogie happily encouraged this line of thinking he wa very lonely and desperate for a chance to live with someone else plus it would ease his financial trouble if i split the rent cost with him honestly i did not think boogie wa the best candidate for a roommate he wa mentally handicapped socially awkward disorganized and far too idealistic i needed somebody to help pay the rent though and boogie wa my only option i had nowhere else to turn until fast forward to the present an old friend of mine from high school give me a call it is joseph he is been saving up money for awhile at his current job and attending class at the local community college he tell me that he is been looking for someone to move out with and i told him that i am in the same boat he tell me about prior roommate who bailed on him or ended up screwing him over financially in some form or another he wish that he could find somebody responsible someone who doe not do drug someone who can hold a job someone who could respect his space me me i wanted this joseph is the only guy i remember from high school in my group of friend who had his head on straight he did not do drug he wa raised by two good parent i have met them before they are amazing he is organized he shower regularly he show up to work on time and he plan for his future in other word he is the exact opposite of boogie for the last two week me and joseph have been looking around for apartment in town i told him to keep an eye out for bedroom place in case boogie wanted to join u joseph know boogie from school too joseph agreed but he seemed a to get a little tense whenever i brought up boogie in our conversation one day joseph found it the perfect place we took the house tour met the landlord who wa very kind and scoped out the detail everything wa going great until i realized something wa wrong where is the third bedroom i asked the landlord and joseph looked at me with a nervous apprehension in their eye catjack we need to to talk joseph said to me we went outside boogie ca not live with u he plainly stated why for one this is a two bedroom flat we should try to find a bedroom then we ca not just second joseph interjected boogie smoke weed dude he is a more of a liability to u than a contributing member of the household smoking weed doe not make him a bad person and he doe not even do it that often let me ask you this catjack how is boogie going to make it to work well he doe not have a car yes and he doe not have a driver is license mmhmm and he doe not have a bike yep so i guess he would want u to drive him uh huh fuck fuck is right joseph i know boogie doe not have it all together but i promised him that we would move out a a team he is been waiting year for someone to come along and help pay a portion of his rent so that he can finally stop living paycheck to paycheck i would be helping him helping him what save money the money that he spends on videogames and junk food whenever he get the chance he doe not budget at all dude he life paycheck to paycheck because he doe not have discipline and he doe not think ahead fuck fuck yes i know i know i just i promised silence fall between u i ca not believe this i told boogie i would help him he need me or else he is never going to escape the crappy little apartment he life in boogie will never get out of that fucking pit on his own if i do not help him no one will his mom is a junkie his dad is in jail and i am the only friend he is got fuck i have no idea what to do should i try to convince joseph to search for a bedroom apartment and insist that boogie come to live with u should i stay with joseph in the bedroom apartment and leave boogie to fend for himself on a minimum wage job and risk losing him a a friend or should i leave joseph behind and honor my promise to boogie,depression

23.42318,-46.151787,i feel like a failure this is going to be long tl dr at bottom and throwaway for my own reason friend know my real username i do not know where else to turn i feel absolutely worthless and i feel like i am living a nightmare me and my wife have always been great i love her she is everything to me and we are still doing great that is not the issue the issue is my work let me explain we have been together for over year and we went from apartment to townhome to finally a house we bought this house two year ago and have loved it since our only problem is we would been using our saving to pay for our rent mortgage only due to the idea that thing were going to get better work wise i have been at my company for almost year now i started overnights in the warehouse month later i moved up to a finance corporate position a a cashier of sort then just month later i wa promoted again to counting then another month the office same department just handling the paperwork fastforward another month or so our company wa bought out different feeling all around we were bought out by the parent company this could be good this could be bad who the fuck know our logic for it being good and this is a huge point in this post wa that we have always been set on this payscale where there were no voluntary promotion or raise you want a promotion usually you would have to work hard and earn it right nope that doe not matter here you need a raise for whatever reason nope that is not how we work we are the company a multi billion dollar company but you want to make more than k year before tax after it is nearly k nope too bad so we were thinking that the buyout would dissolve this payscale a discussion went about it there were promise and everything better healthcare better this better that etc then my department manager left now we were at the mercy of a manager of an entirely different department because they did not want to fill his position just absorb it with no pay raise to those of u who picked up the slack this manager can be nice but about of the time he is flipping out over some bullshit oh well it is manageable no pun intended or so we thought okay back to our office structure for a second from lowest to highest it go cashier counting office specialist supervisor and then stop there then you have the manager instead of the department head whatever we can do this moving forward another year or so to well last year layoff began not for everyone but patch of people delivery driver few staff in our department and others layoff ended now september of last year this is where thing shifted one of our two supervisor left for an accounting position my time to shine this is what i had been busting my as for over the last year i know i can do it i know how to do all the task and duty balance report everything i had literally been bugging my supervisor and manager about learning new thing since i enjoyed it i really loved this job i applied i interviewed i heard i wa the only one to interview i have got this in the bag but wait someone else from another department interviewed for it but she just got another job in our a p department the rule is you have to stay in a new position for month before moving on sweet i have still got this they chose her over me they bent the rule for her i wa left speechless and heartbroken since that day i decided i needed to move on get out of this company she is become tyrannical treating everyone like absolute garbage and throwing people under the bus this in turn make the manager freak out and threaten u we go to hr but of course hr is there for the company not the employee so that brings u to almost currently been applying for job for a year and had three interview after sending in well over application honestly not exaggerating first one january not a good fit fine with me the company wa a bit scarier looking than my current job second one june huge energy company and had a friend that work there still doe tried following up after sending thank you note and never could get a hold of anyone then two week ago august they call me finally to let me know they were picking someone else oh well i just applied to something else that another friend work at third one august now my wife and i is friend used to both work there they are married just had a kid he left to go work for the government she still work there they both said they would be my reference to there they said be kind and you will get the job no problem they like people that blend

28.670776,41.88562,my girlfriend broke up with me during and episode i do not know what to make of it or what i should do about a month ago several thing happened that lead to my girlfriend into having an episode i have only dated her for month and depression ha come up in conversation but not too indepth she said that sometimes she withdraws and shuts people out that she would sometimes need her space depression run in my family too and i suffer from symptom but never bad enough for me to seek help just yet she life in orange county and i live in san francisco ever other weekend or a holiday weekend i would drive down to see her i wa planning on moving to la to start school and make a career change into business with the mindset of starting my own business i wanted to be closer to her a well and i would have never made this choice without her support around this time she came up to san francisco for my birthday and surprised me by bringing my two best friend with her she said it wa because she wanted me to feel loved since i spent most of my life friendless on the way back she spent the night at one of my friend place because it wa a lot close than her place and she had driven through the night when they told me what that she stayed there the next day i wa fine with it at first but ended up getting jealous after she spent the rest of the next day there mi got angry but we talked ind you at this point both of u were feeling stressed out and kind of slipping into a rut on the phone until i calmed down because i did not want to go bed with thing bad i knew nothing had happened between the two of them but i wa just feeling moody the next day tuesday she started a new job and had a blast the day after that she lost her job because she had school that day and could not make it despite telling them that she could not work certain day when she got hired and clearing it with her shift manager the owner still fired her and on the way back from being fired she got into a minor accident that we are all sure wa an insurance scam played by the other driver that day i wa starting to feel really down too between planning the move and our first fight i wa feeling really anxious and nervous when we talked that night i said that i wa scared about all of it and that i wa also scared of losing her she said to me that i did not have to worry about losing her because she wa with me because she wanted to be with me and only me that she loved me and would do what it took to keep out relationship strong and i did not have to worry they day after thursday she lost her phone for most the day i did not hear from her until that night when she had to use her mom is phone to contact me on friday i did not hear from her most of the day and i expressed that i wa feeling ignored because i wa hearing from her le and le when i needed the attention more and more she said that she wa sleeping a lot for some reason the next day she said that wa going on a bike ride and i did not hear from her for day at first i wa a bit worried and asked her brother if he noticed anything different and he even said that she wa sleeping a lot and i realised that she wa probably having an episode and i should give her space a much a i needed attention and reassurance the problem here is that i am an extrovert and i need to discus thing with someone when i am stressed but she is an introvert and need to meditate on thing alone when stressed at this point i resolved not to text or call her so instead i asked her friend if they had seen her have an episode like this before i asked a friend we will call joe and he got back to me saying that around december she had an episode and i should give her space but maybe send a meme every now and again to remind her i am here and thinking about her after discussing this with him i asker her brother about december hoping for more info i also contacted her best friend asking her reach out too no one is getting a response the next day she called me she wa pretty emotional we both were she asked first how i wa and i admitted to being really tore up and having frequent break down i asked how she wa doing and she wa feeling really depressive here is the rest of our conversation am i suffocating you yes ok then i will be sure to reach out le and give you more space i am sorry it took so long for me to realise i love you should i be worried about our relationship distressed noise if you are going to break up with me just do it i do not think i can me with you can i ask why because you are too good for me what what do you mean i do not deserve you you do not understand i am fucked up in the head and i am going to do nothing but hurt you i ca not do that to you no you are not too good for me i do not think so i think you are too good for me i love you and you have made me so happy no i ca not accept that reason for breaking up nope break up did not go through what really brandon told me that you talked to joe about what happened in december and i thought that you would not want me for sure turn out joe and her dated for a few week and she broke up with him similarly and they remained friend i told her i did not really care about that because i have met joe and i did not really feel threatened by him at this point the connection wa kinda bad so i could not hear her properly and after asking her to repeat herself or time i gave up but thing sounded good because the tone of her voice sounded good i think i hear do not call back then the call drop i freak out and call her right back the call doe not go through but she called me right back and the connection is good again another thing that happened is that her dad passed away about a month before this he had been in a coma for the last year resulting in a huge legal battle between her mom and her step sister resulting her step sister winning power of attorney and taking everything away from her a few day before she stopped talking to me her mom had come home drunk and wa screaming about how she and her brother with life sucking free loader and that her dad had his stroke because he couldn t deal with the two of them she is really young and is still worried about what she want to do with her life and her lack of direction she is also really guilty about living at home and feel like a burden to her mom and put up with her toxic family because she can t afford to move out and go to school these word really cut deep after we talk a if everything is normal if not a bit strained she tell me about her day and i tell her about mine before we hang up i agree to give her space and not contact her with our usual frequency and that i tell her for the record the break up did not go through and we are still together she responds you are funny i am not sure how to take that she tell me for the record when i called you i though you would not want to be with me any more and that you would be happy to break up for the next few day i leave her to it joe text me saying that he ha a bad feeling about the way she is acting and it reminds him too much about how she broke it off with him he kept saying thing along those line so i tell him to keep it to himself if all he ha to say is negative stuff he then tell me that her brother what he learned from her brother apparently she took shrooms with this guy we are going to call texas she had an epiphany and ha been at his house everyday since and not really talking to anyone else this put me in a dark place because i am here alone and she is off possibly with someone else so i text her confronting her about it but get no response joe then ask me if i ve seen her profile lately so i check it turn out i m blocked from her facebook and so is joe and all my friend i resign myself to the fact that she is in fact gone and i m not getting her back after a few day of reflection i decided not to trust rumor coming from an ex and her asshole of a brother her brother tends to exaggerate and is a bit toxic himself i can understand if she wa going over there because her want to avoid her house and the toxic people there while i never got the chance to meet texas she s told me about him and he s the only friend that life close enough to casually smoke weed with and i have female friend i hang out with for similar reason i text that to her saying that i ve decided not to trust or believe anything unless i hear it directly from her i also tell her best friend i have decided not to believe the rumor and that i still wanted her or at least talk to her about what happened and maybe be on speaking term again her bff never reply to this her bff doe not like me the most because i talked her out of joining the air force together the day after i sent that to her bff she text me simply i don t want to be with you any more i m sorry to hurt you like this good bye it is been a bit over a week since she sent that text i have not contacted her either and i don t know what to make of it on one hand this read like so many other post about depression break ups and i should not be so worried because when the episode run it s course what feeling she had before should still be there on the other hand other story i ve read doesn t include such complete shut out from what i saw and friend tell me she wa extremely happy when we were together and wa even looking into moving to san francisco to be with me after she completed community college i m worried about being that ex who can t take a hint or move on but i don t know if i should give up hope from what she a told me in plain english i believe she will come back but maybe she wasn t who i thought she wa the whole time she wa with me maybe she really did have a shroom ephiny and left me for texas but is too childish to face me head on the woman i knew and loved would not have handled this so immaturely though or maybe she really is depressed and is just shutting everyone out and i have to be patient and some there for her for some reason i still have her on snapchat and instagram even though those were the way we communicated most besides text i ve been too scared to reach out using those channel though because i don t want to be blocked on those too i wa working on a project a book of love letter that i ve halted when she sent that text i still want to give it to her so at least she know how i felt and the question i never got answer to below you can find a link to the manuscript that i ve already sent to be professionally printed and bound into a book i don t know if and when would be a good time to send it,depression

wanted in the first place with money that i don t have i only bought it to shut my parent up about it because my other one which i much prefer wouldn t pas emission for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same i just absolutely fucking hate being told what i can and can t do with my own damn car that i pay for myself my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own i m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dy down i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well million of people are losing their fucking job it s been a month since quarantine and i can t really even leave my house can t have a social life just feel like i have no one to turn to and i m drowning every fucking day and i m just done i left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip i waited til my family had all gone to bed then i got in my car and just took off i drove hour away into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out i eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minute looking out over it trying to find the ball to drive over the edge i got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started cry thinking to myself how the fuck it came to this and how alone i felt i wa sitting there in the dark with tear streaming down my face when i heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue light i knew it wa a cop at this point but didn t bother trying to hide myself i just leaned on the hood of my car and continued cry to myself he approached with a flashlight and noticed me apparently he thought my car wa abandoned at first he wa a young guy probably about my age he asked for my license and registration which i gave him i d said maybe two word to him at this point and i think he picked up on the fact that i seemed a bit off he asked me how i wa doing and what i wa doing so far from home at this time of night it wa like am at this point i just said that i needed to get out and clear my head at first but eventually i admitted that i had driven up here to kill myself i thought he wa gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital but he actually wa remarkably calm he asked why and what wa going on in my life he even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened i had stopped cry but the tear came flooding back a it all came out how i felt like i had no one he didn t interrupt and even put an arm around me i eventually said i planned to drive my car off this cliff because i wa so unhappy he wa silent for a few second and then told me he knew how it feel to want to die apparently he came close to suicide a few time a quote he said really stuck with me it wa sometimes you can have everything and it still feel like nothing and it hit me that that wa exactly how i felt he gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if i needed to talk we sat there til about ish just talking it wa so nice to just vent to someone eventually he said that he had to get going but knowing what i just told him we both knew he couldn t leave me there alone for obvious reason he walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out flashing his headlight at me to do the same he followed me to the highway turning off onto a side road and honking a he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp i drove the hour back home not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life i never even got his name or badge number i got home close to this morning and no one wa up yet luckily i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about hour i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before no one knew that i went out last night i still haven t told them and i don t plan to they have no idea that i could ve died i called the officer s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again he texted me later in the day saying his offer wa still valid any time i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don t really want to ask everyone ha at least one secret that they ll take to their grave and this is probably mine it s a long shot that he ll read this but if he doe i don t know what to say to him or how to thank him his compassion saved my life it s crazy to think what would ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn t come along when he did he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery i owe him my life cop get a bad rap for being arrogant power hungry racist with itchy trigger finger but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like we wouldn t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being asshole to each other i don t know if there s a department medal for talking a suicidal

54.47934,-44.133873,a close friend of mine is dreadfully depressed and i am depressed too it is a long story i need to know if i am doing the right thing s so i will start with my depression first i am so is she my friend we have known each other for six month and from the beginning i have loved her with all my heart we dated for a month but we broke up because she felt like her depression wa hurting me broke up is quoted because nothing at all ha changed in the way or amount we interact and i would not even consider dating anybody else at this point and neither would she anyways i am a foster child my birth mother wa abusive and neglectful until i wa and escaped from her i wa suicidal went to the hospital and whatnot which is actually how i got away and learned about the rest of the world since i had been entirely isolated since first grade a in i had no interaction with anyone but my mom and did not even go to school my life is good now for the most part my family is great i have got my own gadget phone laptop headphone other stuff learned to play guitar and i have got a ton of nice cali levi american eagle etc clothing courtesy of social service overall i would say i should be happy by most standard and i am not inherently unhappy my depression is practically nothing compared to what it wa a few week ago i started taking antidepressant but they caused me to have anxiety attack so my doctor told me to stop taking them until i see him which is tomorrow overall i am doing well other than being lonely i do not have many friend because when you have no social interaction for of year of your life almost counting bouncing from group home to group home your social skill are not that great lou the depressed girl i will talk about soon and who is the main subject of this post not her real name is the only person i would consider a friend i have had girlfriend and had sex and all and there have been people i have talked to in school once i entered this highschool but none i talk to anymore or ever got close to so other than intense loneliness i am good lou she is a lot worse off she is not in foster care her parent are abusive still she used to be addicted to drug she is on a cocktail of antidepressant now she is mildly suicidal and ha been for a long time she wa seriously suicidal before i knew her she is been raped one of her ex sexually abuse her to this day under threat of violence should she contact the police or try to disappear for good from him she and i have talked extensively about this and we have an action plan once she get into college but until then she wo not do anything i would literally kill the guy myself if i knew where he lived he is not worthy of the title of human and deserves a fate worse than death and she is just a lonely a i am if not more and she is attending counseling so that is just the surface of both of u and only what she is told me because i know there are thing she ha not opened up to anyone about yet since i am the one who is better off and more emotionally stable i have tried my best to be supportive for her i always text her goodnight and good morning frequently remind her i am always here if she need to talk about anything that i love her that it is all going to be okay thing like that she is said recently she feel hopeless so i have taken to attaching reminder of thing she is one day closer to every night when i wish her goodnight thing like when she will save her first life a a nurse or doctor get married be happy that sort of thing for valentine is day i am going to write two long love note and one recording on a micro sd card one love note will be for this year the other will be next year is and have the sd card attached buried in a jar under folded piece of paper reminding her of thing she is one day closer to which i will tell her to open one per day i will make a second jar of paper with various feel good thing on them and tell her to open some whenever she feel particularly down like how beautiful her green eye are joke thing like that so am i doing the right thing in this situation i know that nothing i can possibly do will cure her depression is not like that i know since i experienced severe depression myself my aim is to try and help her keep her head up a little higher and focus on what is coming rather than the horror that wa and is her life and overall just to make sure she know someone love her unconditionally no matter how bad thing get or how lowly she think of herself and to basically just be supportive aside from all that she is recently become really antisocial nearly cutting all contact with me and her other best friend she is known for a few year she will send me about text per day top in response to whatever i send her which is in stark contrast to the constant talking we have done since we first met a far a i know this is not good but also is not entirely abnormal i am a little worried about it though could any of this make her feel worse somehow i have thought it over myself and i am doubtful but extra perspective would be helpful thanks,depression

-78.44115,21.126095,m four year into formal recovery and i am exhausted i have been depressed for something like half of my life i wa first formally diagnosed at sixteen and later diagnosed with abuse related ptsd but i truanted extensively even before then i spent year with an abuser and the effect of that ha been dramatic i am aware that whenever i write about this it seems bizarrely dispassionate and detached but i do not really know how to talk about it in a way which is not immediately emotionally set to eleven and dullness therefore seems preferable i created a burner to post here because while i willingly talk about the domestic abuse aspect of what happened to me i do not really discus the sexual abuse part of what happened to me i nosedived out of school at attempted suicide went to germany basically to have something to do attempted suicide again learned german had a few job came back to the uk lost a couple of job found my current job one i enjoy obtained a university place to study german in which i am fluent more formally and i have finally gotten to a point where i superficially and externally seem like a functional person and now i feel a though i am deceiving everyone i meet people like simple answer and they like recovery narrative people see that i have a good job and a routine and i speak a second language thing which granted are helpful for stabilising depression and conclude that i am now capital b better which feel like an enormous amount of pressure i have had cycle of being outwardly functional which then fall apart and nosedive into really intense suicidal ideation including the aforementioned suicide attempt i feel myself editing my biography in real time which of course everybody doe but i have to cut out such enormous section of my life that i feel like a ghost with no real experience nothing about my childhood is untainted every anecdote i want to tell i realise is impossible to explain without explaining abuse or truancy or this messed up succession of trauma when i have sought out counselling i have found it completely unhelpful i am the sort of person who feel a lot of pressure to get an a at everything and that includes making a good impression on my counsellor passing the invisible test being a favourite patient i find it distressing that counsellor ca not tell i am lying to them i have had counsellor smile right to my face and tell me i am making good progress while i am day away from attempting again because i am good at faking superficial progress and telling people what they want to hear the last time i attempted suicide wa three day after a counselling session in which i wa told that i could begin transitioning out of the service because of how well i wa doing since then i have found it impossible to engage with talk therapy and i become more distrustful of mental health professional a time go on i feel deceitful constantly feel like i am successfully lying to everyone feel phony and fake when thing go well it feel like i am frantically erecting mental health potemkin village for anyone who glance my way because i am so scared of failing to live up to this recovery narrative they have of me added to this is that i am gay and not really particularly good looking abuse ha made me physically very cagey i do not really know how to resolve how i feel about sex and i find the mainstream gay community really intimidating i find myself wanting physical intimacy not necessarily sex which is something i have never really had even with friend or family but i feel like inflicting the past i have had and the issue i have on someone is completely unfair i feel extremely undesirable once again i have done the thing you are supposed to do i exercise regularly on top of that i walk a lot i have been eating better it is showing result and i get the endorphin rush whoopee that will take time but all the time i have this feeling that my entire body ha been irreparably tainted by what my abuser did to me it is hard to care what happens to this body when it feel soiled and corrupted hard not to view my body a this disgusting enemy for me my entire body is a reminder of what happened to me and the idea of it being involved in sex make me want to physically throw up i would love to have a relationship but i feel like there is so much in the way not only is the dating pool th the size at a generous estimate but i do not think any guy think yeah i am really up for dating a guy who will physically recoil when i try to kiss him i find it really hard to imagine the idea of someone seeing me naked the thought repulse me i am not asexual and i am attracted to guy on a daily basis but when i try to imagine myself a a part of sex all the horrible shit that happened to me get in the way i am on okcupid and such currently gearing up to meet a guy for the first time off of there just for a chat and i feel like it is inevitable that he is going to find me a disgusting a i do if there is one thing i find impossible even after year and year it is breaking my conviction that my body is disgusting i am not sure why i am writing all this i am not unrealistic about depression and i knew that i would probably be dealing with cycle of it my entire life i also know recovery take time and that the step i have taken are good one i have even been able to feel some sense of achievement about what i have done so far i suppose for me the dissonance is that i have spent year trying to be the good patient and i am finding it harder and harder to hold on while these gradual process take shape i understand that this process take time but i have to be alive in the meantime and i am finding it harder and harder to keep going i take my med and i am proactive i force myself to have a social life keep myself busy most night a week and then i come home and i am still miserable over and over again this ha gotten really long but i suppose i am just frustrated and losing hope with the entire concept of recovery i do what people tell me i take all the condescending depression advice and i am still here struggling a much a i ever have i am trying to be patient but i am perpetually restless again sorry for the length i think i largely just wanted to vent,depression

move into law i have a ba in accountancy and an msc in accounting financial management a well a experience a sole company accountant for business with multi million pound turnover per year i am currently taking an evening course at uni to become cilex qualified legal executive i am over qualified for any entry level law position but under qualified for any other law position no one want to hire someone who ha managed million of pound and ha an msc to type out dictation no one want to hire someone who ha no previous law experience to be a paralegal so since january i have been unemployed living with my partner unable to get a job i tried getting another accounting job but walked out of the interview in tear literally half way through because it is not what i want to do and i could not bring myself to do it i got a basic accounting position at a law firm perfect they even agreed to consider transferring me to the law department if i did well after two month but they let me go after two day apparently i wa learning quickly but my dress wa not formal enough for the environment and i did not want to travel to banbury i wa literally given the option of taking the day off or going to banbury and told it did not matter which i chose apparently it did i live in leicester so it wa a bit of a trek for me it broke me i have been depressed since february but now i am almost suicidal car payment have been declined gas and electric for the flat i rent out declined i ca not keep asking my partner for more money he ha already lent me he can afford it but for me it is a matter of pride a well i am a very proud person and it is killing me that i ca not look after myself i am an intelligent person i have got two degree i have had job managing million of pound so now i feel like crap my medication is not even touching it any more the worst thing is i have two step child i love them dearly i have never wanted child of my own but these two are amazing kid one is and the other is going on i used to escape to my flat if i wa feeling bad but now i have got nowhere to go i have to sit and smile and play with them and inside all i want to do is go to bed and curl up and never get out they want me to go and ride bike with them and fly kite but leaving the house is hard especially when i know i will have to go and smile and run around playing tig and usually losing i do not really have any friend to confide in and now i am unemployed i sit around all day everyone i know is at work i probably only get dressed showered or day a week i get to spend hour every day thinking about it i ca not sleep at night because it is all i can think about i hope it is not affecting my relationship but i know it is how could anyone date someone like this he think it is my fault i have not got a job yet but i have tried so hard doe he think i want to sit here all day my sex drive ha completely disappeared i usually have a really high sex drive our relationship ha a lot of kink and bdsm i guess i just needed to say all that i sit here all day in tear even getting out of bed is hard work usually what happens if i do get out of bed is i go downstairs and lie on the sofa with a duvet and my laptop i do not know why i am posting here i just do not know what to do anymore i have not told my partner that i am suicidal because he ha enough on his plate with kid and work and supporting me and i know i should be doing more housework but anyone with depression know that it is not easy although i am trying not to use that a an excuse and do what i can he doe the cooking and washing up while i do the laundry most of the time and vacuuming his best friend is dying of brain cancer she ha month to live his grandma is in a home and last weekend he spent a whole day cleaning up and clearing her house she lived in somerset so a looong way from leics she probably wo not last the year either i do not think there is a point to my existence any more i am christian but even prayer is not helping much any more with so few friend i do not know if anyone except steve and the kid would even miss me i have never been the favourite child and i have not spoken to my dad since christmas but that is a whole other story i am pretty sure that my mom love my brother in law more than me most of the time he is the son she never had but always wanted mom is going through a divorce so i have to appear strong for her sake i have to smile and laugh but it kill me she doe not live nearby so we usually call each other once a week i do not know any more i have stopped caring if i live or die i hope for an accident that someone will crash into me on the motorway or i will get run over crossing the road or something anything i guess i just needed to get this out in one go i do not want to be here anymore,depression
-5.39407,97.07434,st post not sure if it belongs to start off even after reading the rule i am not sure if this post belongs here or not yes i am here to vent tell a story and gain perspective i may not already have and maybe learn something however i also hesitantly say that i have a message for those who stick around to read it so stay awhile and listen this idea came a few hour ago when for some unholy reason literally everything decided it wanted to remind me it wa there i have dealt with a host of issue since well birth diagnosed with a d d to adhd and finally culminating in a mild form of aspergers in my mid teen oh and of course ya boi depression throw in some physical mental abuse in those year and you get a lovely cocktail called me furthest back i can recall thing getting really bad wa involving a girl i will call katie not her real name sure i had put up with the aforementioned abuse and all to a degree but moving on katie went to the church i wa a part of at the time and a well ended up going to my highschool and me being a teenage guy kind of a shy nerdy type crushed haaaard on my amazingly goofy gorgeous and spastic friend i tried being there for her whenever i could because she too had depression and other issue we always made joke or picked on eachother lightly she would sometimes steal my energy drink in the morning and be a ball of spazz the whole day fast forward one day i came into school and since it wa november i wa a wee bit shivery so what doe she do take her hoodie off and make me wear it the whole day i went around in her hoody smelling like her and grumbling awkwardly later that day i mustered up the gut to ask her if she wanted to date me memory is fuzzy there but i remember being happy my last memory of her is her standing by a

better than i had in year emotionally mentally you name it showed me all sort of amazing and new experience made me feel like i wa worth a damn buckle up dorothy kansa is going bye bye i ignored alot of thing early on snide remark here controlling comment there then boom after i moved down here to be closer to her partly to save the sinking ship i started getting the full treatment lie hypocrisy

honesty that wa all in the span of time roughly a year after my mom checked out year of being ground into the dirt of letting my health decline to the point my teeth are a dentist wet dream my liver and heart want out and i am sure youtube is not reccomending counselingjust for the advertiser and that all ended early this year month after our final breakup after i lost my car and got to deal with

heavier when wet and most car do not care about splashing you i fucking did it i kept fucking going i think i wa fueled by pure spite at this point i wa not going to let my ex have the satisfaction of beating me down and having me fail i wa gonna prove i could do this i wa not gonna take the easy option of moving to texas with folk by myself or die trying disclaimer i did have help in various form week ago i finally got a new car i can barely afford it and i am still way behind on rent but i fucking did it i have a stable job albeit boring a hell and i have a car then hello darkness my old

-16.461393,-100.35988,wanting to truly get clean more frequently and more strongly please help me use this weekend to get a jump on facing wds and recovering ever since i started using i have always tried to control my habit convincing myself i wa in control if i wa always using a dose small enough to taper down from pretty easily every once in a while i would get sick of everything associated with using but wa always able to rationalize going back to that small amount just enough to not feel awful but not too much that i lose control i do not know when i fully admitted to myself i wa an addict but for some reason that fact did not really matter to me anyway one new really annoying aspect of what i feel my addiction ha done to me is unravel this anxiety and paralysis everyone here probably know it to some extent every single decision no matter how small take a really uncomfortably long time even just deciding what word to say to someone in a conversation i will just get stuck and locked into a silence where it is like my brain just give up searching for something to say and give in to my indecision and produce awkward silence that make me cringe i am self aware enough to know it happens but not in control enough to jump in and stop it i feel like a bystander looking down at my most fucked up self anyway the reason i even brought that up is because every time i start writing anything these day it take hour whether it is a couple sentence or an essay so hopefully all these new insight and hopefully genuine urge to actually be clean are true since i know my addict mind ca not always be trusted i have to rely on external fact of change or progress toward turning my life around one of them is that in the past month i have been coming to this sub more and more and opiate le and le i feel like i am still very weak but part of me want to quit to avoid the depression and anxiety i have induced into myself after year of poisoning my body and mind but anyway here is where i am exactly right now i take mg suboxone day and have been for a while now unfortunately my job ha become a source of stress and anger and everything that being sober exacerbates and that ha driven me to occasionally allow myself a high vacation every few week last night i started one of these little vacation using about mg total sublingual fent over the course of the night now here i am with the weekend ahead of me i have more fent but i also have full mg strip of suboxone about mg subutex pill they are all broken up so hard to tell exactly how much and pretty much every possible other aid i could use to help get clean clonidine benzos weed stool softener dear lord do i need to take a shit lope which i think i will hold off on due to previous item on the list a couple other related drug soma not sure if that is helpful or just pure trouble in term of trying to use it a a kind of lesser evil substitute for opioids since i have a pretty low tolerance to them and get a benzo type spaghetti leg goofy sensation from it but the most important thing is this growing feeling that i genuinely want to stop so i have all these tool mainly desire to start turning my life around and precious weekend day i just took about mg suboxone after waking up in wd from the fent not horrible but damn is that half life short so given all these tool and my mindset i have no excuse for not being able to at least try to really face my addiction head on and try to fight despite all these tool i have that can help me stop it is obviously never enough so i guess what i am looking for are idea on how to best use this weekend to my advantage i took a small amount of benzo soma and after trying to decide whether i should a very small amount of suboxone given all these thing if you can take all these variable and either think of how to use them in combination the best way and make the most possible progress this weekend would be awesome both idea and support from people who i know understand what i am going through to be specific here is two thing i am trying to find an activity or adventure or hobby that will help fill the depression that will set in soon i am inclined to play video game and watch tv but i need a better plan yesterday on an impulse i set a daily event on my phone to remind me to either spend some time either exercising writing meditating or anything similar to that if i can stick to that and just try to embrace more therapeutic and healthy activity that could really help i also am trying to figure out how to use the arsenal of wd fighting drug listed above so i guess any activity or plan you can recommend to me given these parameter i have provided to help me maximize on this weekend to make some progress or at least start that process if it will be a long one i will likely come back here and add other detail and context to my situation to both help you guy think of idea both for my and y ourselves to use this weekend to start firing away at my addiction and freeing myself of it thanks in advance for any idea or combination of these tool i have at my disposal i can use to maximize my progress in this weekend again i rambled way more than i wanted but hopefully this is somewhat coherent and if people think they may have advice for me but feel like they need more variable about my situation i will try to provide a many a i feel comfortable providing so any idea thanks and good luck to all of you maybe together we can brainstorm activity and a taper plan involving the various tool in my wd kit,drug_addiction

-29.323076,-50.65278,tw trauma story emotional flashback tw emotional flashback schizophrenic family member i have only recently begun to recognize certain thing i do a informed by ptsd and with the ability to put a name to the feeling i have i am surprised at how often i have emotional flashback just last night i had a terrible one it is been almost year edit it s actually accidentally calculated from my college graduation not high school since i began my journey of healing aka since i left home but the past two have been the biggest i think that is why my flashback last night wa so shocking to my system i ca not get it out of my head i wa laying in bed muscle tense a always curled up in the fetal position when i started to feel anxious lately i have been trying to put away screen an hour before bed and do a little reading but this ha also been really hard because it mean i have to slow down and be present with myself one of the other big realization of this past year is that i use workaholism and obsessive compulsive medium consumption tv video game reading youtube etc etc etc to distract myself from being alone with my thought so when i put myself to bed at a reasonable hour without any ongoing distraction i immediately remembered how it felt to be awake in bed a a kid waiting for the other shoe to drop i do not have the more expected experience of trauma i grew up in a house with a schizophrenic father he loved me deeply and would never harm me i recently commented elsewhere about this if you are curious feel free to look at my history regardless any time i wa home i wa waiting for my father to scream out from the middle of an episode i wa listening for the creaking of the stair or the thump of his cane in the kitchen so i knew where he wa at all time my parent are deaf and so our house wa very quiet growing up to know where people were you had to really pay attention i now have a ridiculously exaggerated startle response i wa a middle schooler teen and did not know how to handle what wa going on and i did not have a great support system during that time i wish thing had been different but it is what it is i also had untreated ocd and so my thought would spiral out of control and ob over certain thing one of the more obvious trigger given my experience is the fear that i am schizophrenic it wa so hard to ignore at night and so last night i compulsively reached for the same thought i brushed up against it and i panicked i spiraled so quickly and i tensed up even more i wa running through all the traumatic ocd panic attack i remember hating myself and feeling so unsafe in my own home i wanted my roommate and best friend to just come home from her date so i wa le alone le absorbed in my own thought of course wanting that made me feel worse not even she know how bad it get for me even though we have been friend for year and have lived together for a year and a half i am so used to being independent i probably have attachment issue i have never dated that i have never really gone in depth about this stuff with anyone and of course i wa like i need to get up i need to move around and distract myself i know it help but i wa literally frozen i could only move my toe i stayed like that for about an hour muscle twitching here and there and just mentally analyzing my memory my mental issue myself i eventually wa able to move so i set up some asmr to help myself relax but i had a bad night is sleep which ha been an issue since i moved a month ago and i am still quite shaken i have never posted here and i am not quite sure what i am looking for i guess part of me is writing this to validate my own experience i ca not help but wonder is this really an emotional flashback of course it is i need to stop invalidating my own feeling and experience,ptsd
14.343752,41.908516,you worried the house would be condemned yet you have done nothing to prevent it i ca not sleep i am remembering the final hell i had to endure before i finally moved out i am pretty sure my mom cope with her trauma by giving all her love to her precious stray i often wished she showed me that much affection and attention but because of this we went from a two cat household when i wa to a currently cat household that is too many cat for how much space we had i am sure we went through thousand of dollar of cat food the routine she go through daily is tedious but i digress last winter we had an extreme cold snap and my mom wa worried about the sister of my cat because both of their parent died and the other stray were competitive a hungry cat are she let maddy into the house and thus began the final hell maddy wa freaked out about being in a house with other cat who kept hissing at her so she hid in the basement well the basement had a colony of flea after that fateful night and i never wanted to die so much a that period of time our clothes and bath towel were stored in the basement because we had to shower in the basement out of a sink with a hose because the upstairs shower never worked for most of the time i lived in that house i wa the first to feel like something wa crawling on me but i wa not really listened to until mom witnessed it once i went down the basement for clothes and ran cry and screaming with my leg covered in flea i genuinely hate reliving this i feel like thing are crawling on me everytime anyway i got so fed up one day that i looked on a website which wa apparently affiliated with another company i do not think i should say it here but i did not know that the website asks for your phone number and name and location which okay is kinda sus now that i think about it but it made perfect sense because i wa trying to find an exterminator in our area the company ended up calling our house later that night i got in trouble for looking for help grandmom wa pissed and mom wa freaking out that if we invite an exterminator in he is gonna take one look at the house and condemn it i have no idea whether or not that wa a paranoid overstatement because everything looked fine aside from my mom and me just hoarding paper and not cleaning but there wa also a cat who literally lived her whole life on the kitchen table would not leave not even to go to the bathroom because she wa so nervous of my cat attacking her and another cat in the living room with the same problem if you look further the basement wa infested with flea a washing machine on it last leg because mom did not want to call a repairman because it wa gonna die anyway it wa fine it finally broke down like i predicted among other thing she really liked to wait until thing were really really broken to ask for help jesus the two original cat are going through what i went through she love my original cat soooo much but would she take her to the vet for a checkup or antidepressant or teeth cleaning unless she immediately started displaying an illness in front of her no i excused it because we were struggling with money but we were struggling because of mom this wa a hell of her own making she should not even have that many cat if we were struggling and i let her know it frequently sometimes i would even suggest maybe we should put our cat up for adoption even the one that have been living with u for year because nobody fucking love them in that house but then regret it because it would hurt them to be abandoned and no one want senior cat anyway especially not my mom is favorite she wa anxious to the point of aggression along with the whole kitchen table thing i wa literally so stressed out because i wa supposed to travel home this past christmas to the point it wa affecting me physically i cried all the time until someone on the outside told me it is okay to set boundary and cancel my trip because if i did go it would ruin holiday for me for year i did not go and i wa okay i miss my cat and my friend and the place i used to be able to go but i am okay and safe here i really want to be better than her,ptsd

10.500066,-64.01734,my new trauma is shaping who i am hello all i m new here and while scrolling through all of your story i came to realize i didn t have an overly abusive childhood there were instance where i didn t feel loved or wanted that i wa a burden because i am different from my sibling i wa always put in a different box because i had a different dad and no attention wa paid to me because i had more materialistic thing than my sibling because i got two of everything a an adult i crave attention from my mom i don t want too but i do i want to be treated like i m smart and have done well for myself but it doesn t happen it s very hard letting go of this idea i can make it better by being here all the time but i also feel very hurt when i m not invited to thing it s like i ll always be an after thought about month ago my mom aunt and i were out having fun with a couple of friend i wa the designated driver and offered to drive our friend home the plan wa to drop my mom off and my aunt and i go to our friend to hang out before the holiday it wa just meant to be a good night loving the people we were with and just feeling good about being in the moment i wa briefly annoyed with my aunt because she just had to stop and get food for her son even though it wa midnight and the kid should have been asleep a soon a we got back on the road my annoyance dissipated we were singing laughing and dancing we were truly just enjoying each other s company we dropped my mom off with the food and started driving again listening to t pain driving about minute down the road i turned back and looked at my aunt a she wa laughing part of me wish i never looked forward part of me wish i never saw the headlight around am a drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel and crossed the middle yellow line hitting u head on at highway speed i don t even remember the crash i just remember the all encompassing fear of realizing i wa about to die there wa absolutely nothing i could have done to stop the crash from happening i lifted my head up from the steering wheel and just listened it wa quiet for a few minute until my hearing came back and then it wa just loud people were running back and forth talking to me and my passenger siren going off i listened to my aunt panic in the back seat screaming i wanted to tell her it wa okay but i never got the chance i didn t hear her again i wa trapped in the car for over an hour the dash pushed my knee up to my chest with the steering wheel constricting my movement i knew i wa in bad shape but it wa hard to process it they had to cut the top of the car off lean my seat back a far a possible and slide me out that wa the only time i screamed i remember it all i wa life flighted to a level trauma unit where my amazing orthopedic trauma surgeon stated i needed surgery asap or else i would lose my foot i wa trying to focus on what wa being said around me and not peeing myself while i laid naked on a back board when a detective came and talked to me he asked me question about the accident what i remembered if i had been drinking who i wa with he followed up with i m sorry to inform you but your aunt ha died my aunt died from severe catastrophic injury from a seatbelt that failed it didn t lock how it wa supposed to causing the belt to destroy her inside i felt like i had died with her i wanted to die with her my world tilted on it axis and i just couldn t stop thinking i killed my aunt that she wa dead because of me i could and should have done more it wa like the never ending cycle of grief and self loathing they wheeled me back into surgery and i will never be more grateful for that black nothingness my mind needed i wa in the hospital for week and a nursing home for month unable to walk for and am still attending physical therapy it s an every day struggle just living my body is not my own anymore and it s like learning how to be someone else i lost everything my independence my home my car my life and my cat i lost an aunt who i wa extremely close with i lost so much and i m lost in life my second passenger sustained catastrophic injury and wa briefly paralyzed before they reversed it he s doing mostly okay but still in daily pain from the abdominal surgery my third passenger walked out with cut and bruise but mostly okay the lady who hit u ha two young child the disregard she had for their life is heartbreaking i know she didn t set out to hurt anyone but the consequence of her action have been life altering that s a decision that never should have been made she wa recently sentenced to year prison year probation with a few other provision attached to them i don t know how to react or feel i m sad for her but i m also so angry i can t see straight i find it hard to have gratitude for the people who have been here through it all i didn t ask for this i didn t want this i struggle with the anxiety of every day living and being in a car at night i panic if my mom or sibling are out late and i don t hear from them if something happens in the car when i m not paying attention i have an over exaggerated response i know all of this is part of the ptsd i suffer from but i m struggling with it i ve struggled with it the most the past couple of day because kobe s and his daughter and everyone else on that helicopter death rocked me it wa sudden and tragic and i can imagine that same terror i felt they felt i can imagine the helplessness and horror shortly after learning of their death i learned a good friend from high school who i got in a lot of trouble with wa murdered by her boyfriend the panic attack it trigged wa out of left field i thought i wa dealing with my panic attack because i hadn t had one in awhile but learning of her murder wa like the crash happened all over again i honestly don t know how to deal with anything i m going to a therapist and she s been giving me good skill to help deal with the anxiety and depression it work most day but

-14.279171,58.53486,i just want to share i have never told anyone these thing but i want to start moving forward trigger warning sexual physical abuse emotional trauma this will be a wall of text i guess this start when i wa young when i wa i came to the realization that i wa transgender this wa a while ago so most people then were not familiar with the idea and i wa stuck feeling like a freak so naturally i kept this to myself and stayed bottled up with my emotion the way i dealt with it wa to put on a tough guy image which made me a bit of an asshole combined with being a hardcore nerd it wa a recipie for being ostracized at school when i wa i managed to make friend with a guy a few year older than me he wa just a nerdy a me and we gradually became close enough for him to come out to me a gay he knew that it doe not bother me and seeing his trust let me open up to him a little i told him that i wa too because it seemed like a good stepping stone to coming out a trans we started to date in secret and over a few month i got the courage to come out properly to him he did not react how i expected him to he wa pissed off at me he told me if i wanted to be a bitch he would show me what a bitch is good for dragged me off and sexually abused me i wa in shock and the one person i felt safe with had turned against me this kept on going on for a little over a month and i somehow convinced myself that this is how a normal relationship wa he wa right i wa disgusting and weird after a little over a month of this he graduated moved and i never heard from him again with all this my plan to come out to my family wa shattered and i turned into a complete recluse the only place i felt safe were my room the comic shop and the net cafe where i pretty much grew up i went through high school being bullied for being socially awkward and withdrawn although no one did anything to me physically i think it wa because i had a growth spurt and ended up much taller than everyone else even so i wa an easy target somehow i made it through high school and into university where by luck a few people from my gaming clan were doing the same comp sci course a me for the first time in year i had friend although i learned not to properly open up to them we would work on counterstrike mod and map together but honestly it wa pretty superficial i discovered there wa a queer collective at the uni and figured that i could find the support to come out from people in it by this point the depression from being in the wrong body wa unbearable and it wa a battle between this and the utter fear of anyone finding out somehow though i managed to make it though the door and go to the meeting and for a few month i sat in there being silent taking in the counterculture i felt safe here because everyone in the room had gone through a similar life to me and one of the girl there started trying to break me out of my shell we did not have much in common but at the same time she wa an amazing person and kept inviting me to hang out with her and her friend for the first time i had a friendship that wa not superficial i told her about being trans and she helped me build my confidence after month of finding a sense of self worth i decided i could not wait any longer and came out to my parent they were completely fine with it which somehow just made me angry here wa something i wa tearing myself up over for year out of fear and what i did not need to fear anything from them it wa also a relief but their reaction were underwhelming a few week later i saw a doctor who referred me to a therapist and after my first meeting i got the hormone that i had been dreaming of my entire life for the first time i wa feeling truly happy i wa making more friend started going to party and the body i hated started turning into one i wa proud of then one day i decided to go to the beach i wa not sure exactly how to dress for it i wa still in the early stage of transition and at that point i wa just androgynous being worried that i would not pas a a girl yet i decided to just wear boardshorts i wa sunbathing and a drunk guy came up to me at first he wa hitting on me and that freaked me out a bit i did not realize that i would pas to him and from his perspective he must have seen a topless girl at a beach but then he started squinting at me and asking if i wa a girl then he became angry and started hitting me he kept punching me until i blacked out when i came to i wa in the surf club with emt is looking over me and after a few question they told me i had a mild concussion and kept trying to cheer me up by telling me i would have an impressive bruse fuck them the guy had been arrested and i wa taken to the police station to record a statement and while i wa waiting i oveheard some cop making bet on whether i wa a guy or a girl i do not know how to explain this but that wa one of the most soul crushing thing to hear especially considering being androgynous wa what caused this in the first place i became withdrawn again and closed back into my shell the whole world frightened me and i just had this overwhelming sense of fear whenever i went outside i could not concentrate on my uni work and eventually dropped out about a year later i met my current girlfriend she is also transgender and i felt it wa my last shot finding someone i could trust to be perfectly honest with myself i am still not sure that i am actually attracted to girl but there wa no way i could handle a guy being attracted to me the idea just terrifies me but she is kind loving and shared my interest we moved to sydney and got an apartment together sydney wa one of the worst place i have ever lived though and everything just fell apart there one night i wa walking with some friend and we were mugged by a bunch of guy with knife we managed to run away but my friend lost his phone to the robber another night three muscly drunk dude decided to chase me down a street i had no idea what they wanted but i had no intention of finding out another time some guy from oxford street basically the lgbt area of the city invited me to their place to play some p game i wa on mdma at the time and feeling trustful so i made a stupid decision and went with them they had torn most of my clothes off before they realized i wa trans and their shock gave me enough time to run away then my girlfriend started acting weird she wa having amemories that were basically thing i had opened up to her about and went through wild personality change sometimes she would just be angry and hateful then other time she would be afraid and need someone to hold her all this went on while my flatmate turned into a psychopathic meth head meth dealer and would accuse u of stealing her stash she wa too tweaked out to realize that she wa smoking it all one day i just broke down and realized i could not handle it anymore we moved out to her parent place where i thought i could just take a break from the world but my girlfriend just started changing more and eventually just stopped sleeping it wa becoming clear she wa falling into some kind of psychosis and once again i had to put my feeling on hold her dad took her to the hospital and the doctor there involuntarily committed her i just wanted to break down and cry but i could not i had to be there for her and help her get better after a few month she started to return to her old self but i do not think i will ever feel anything again the last year of my life were hell and i feel completely stuck unable to do

7.9218345,29.233788,i think i have reached my limit no idea where to go from now this will be a long post i apologize for that this will be the first time i actually tell everything to anyone like this i have only told a few friend some part because most of them have their own issue to deal with and i do not want to burden them with mine too in hindsight pushing this on stranger seems even more selfish but i do not know what else to do anymore also i am not a native english speaker just to mention that this is for anyone that want and can listen be warned that this get increasingly dark and fucked up towards the end i have been trying to write a tl dr version for half an hour now but i simply ca not year old and i am stuck i have been suicidal i still am but not in any risk of immediate suicide i know that sound weird but it will soon make sense i have been battling my own inner despair for almost year now right now i have become aware that i have started to shut down emotionally i could not care le if i die or not but i do not want to make anyone else sad and i am both a stubborn and analytic person so i guess you could say i am not in immediate threat of suicide that i am aware of maybe i do not know anymore i have been thinking of suicide a lot lately but it doe not feel like i will do it there is no reason for it yet what i am worried about is other people around me it just feel like i went through so much shit in the past year that my own mind is shutting out any kind of emotion that doe not help it survive i do have two emotion remaining that i can still feel rage and love thankfully they are not both directed to the same person and ironically i think they are both keeping me alive but one of them might kill me soon both are my fuel right now but it is an uncertain existence if i lose my girlfriend for whatever reason i am only left with rage or if i lose control of that rage for whatever reason i lose everything i know i could not live with myself if i hurt anyone else i simply could not but i ca not seem to dig myself out of this hole anymore so right now i am pretty sure i might hurt someone and then end my life or end my life in fear of hurting someone it is fucked up to even read it written like this but it doe not even come close to how it feel it is hard to explain a combination of effort injustice and fuckup some of mine some from external party led me to the point in life where i am now so i guess i will go like that it will be long because i am just not sure what is important anymore i know i need help but i ca not seem to get it i asked for it went after it and basically got my ball crushed i guess i will start with my family and where i live i live in a european country where the primary two solution for any mental healthcare issue are a suck it up and stop being a bitch b get stigmatized by the entire community local or national very little difference then be considered and treated a a crazy person it is basically like this if anyone ever find out you are on something like anti depressant they will actively avoid you and start looking for excuse to fire you if you work for them i am a product of an arranged village marriage no i am not joking i grew up in a small and frankly beautiful village but my actual family is anything but beautiful my mother wa married to my father when she wa pretty much without her consent in exchange for a goddamn house right now she is a mental mess and she can be downright venomous without thinking she developed a temper and is quite an expert when it come to guilt tripping and verbal abuse but i guess she ca not be blamed for being like that it is a consequence of everything she went through my father is a hard worker but always took my mother and pretty much everything else he had for granted he is a war vet and an alcoholic he is incapable of empathy regardless if drunk or sober and stubborn a hell we fought and still fight a lot at time i do not see him a a human being anymore he seems like an empty shell of a man he got his first job through his father connection but he ha not made any connection for himself he just did what he wa told and never thought for himself he wa at risk of losing his job over year back on account of his drinking my sister and i both lied for him tried to pull him out of trouble pulled a many favor a we could we got him into a rehab program he did not drink for a while maybe month or so then he went right back to his old pattern and still lost his job his job wa a major source of income for our family so we started struggling hard all our saving were bleeding out slowly i wa still employed at the time he is the source of my rage but ha not been a target of it yet other than verbally i have been unemployed for year now year ago i took on a job a a security guard bodyguard in another city just to get away from my family i lived with my sister for a while then got my own place life in general wa good other than the fact that the job wrecked me physically shift were in standard hour block due to fucked up regulation allowing something like that in our country and on average i worked anywhere from to hour a month i gained a lot of weight really fast and ended up with knee surgery the surgeon messed something up and i wa still hemmoraghing in my knee for several day after the procedure it wa initially an arthroscopy procedure and they did not want to open my knee up fully so they basically drained blood through puncture and whatnot not sure what the exact medical term for it is in english this mark the first time i had trouble with doctor in my country after that year ago i took another job in one of our major telecom call center straight from my old security guard job with no break inbetween it wa a nice job initially steady hour shift i advanced to call center manager within month i actually got a lot of experience from my old job related to it but that is another story and the pay wa more than adequate for me to live comfortably unfortunately within the next month thing went to shit nationally our company changed sale policy then introduced insane sale quota for call center we could not reach daily quota in hour so they pushed our department into overtime for week hour per day of course we did not get fully paid overtime since regulation in our country are shitty this lasted for month until i broke down i just could not get myself out of bed one morning my body felt like it weighed a ton long story short i wa constantly tired could not focus on anything anymore not my job or my personal relationship everything suffered my company started blaming me for loss and eventually i heard that my regional manager who pushed u all so hard wa trying to shift the blame on me with the possibility of pay severance i could not get out of my slump and i basically quit my job a month after i heard that during the time all this shit wa flying around on my job i wa also helping my father with trying to not lose his job went to see my doctor and did some general test everything ok but eeg which had a borderline result that pointed to epilepsy for some reason they gave me some med and sent me on my way told me to check back in day or so i got worse in addition to feeling like a truckload of tired shit i now started getting memory blackout i would forget what i wa trying to do or simply find myself in another place without knowing how the hell i got there went to an emergency checkup did some more specialized test no anomaly no tumor no blood defficiencies nothing they gave me more med one of them wa an anti depressant i got worse now in addition to blank in my memory and chronic fatigue now i wa also getting cascading full body cramp this wa the worst pain i felt in my entire life a part of my body would start to cramp up randomly and then it would expand to my entire body within a minute it wa not just the pain that i remember i bit through my tongue once thankfully not completely in half shat myself twice and broke two of my upper front teeth replacing them wa expensive a hell and my sister had to help out financially i moved back in with my parent since my saving dried up and it wa risky for me to live alone due to those cramp and memory blank there wa no internet at their place at the time so i went a full year with minimal contact with the outside world i lost touch with most of my friend doc replaced some of my med but nothing changed my thought felt scrambled my body occasionally tried to tear itself apart and this wa already lasting for a year with no positive result i wa at my low point i had nothing left and for the first time in my life i genuinely wanted to kill myself for the first time i felt the feeling of true despair i told that to my sister and my parent i told them that what the doctor are doing doe not feel like it is helping i fought against my own mind and tried my absolute hardest to form what i wanted to say a a coherent subject it all just resulted in several huge fight where they concluded that i should be ashamed of myself and told me to suck it up let is just say it all just made my rage fuel tank bigger a month passed and i told my parent that i will spend a weekend at my own place so i could find some stuff on the internet i wa not exactly lying i just left one thing out if i did not find what i wa looking for a way out of all that shit i wa going to kill myself then i had no girlfriend at that time nothing left that i would value and i decided that if i wa ever going to end it all it had to be then since my parent could still afford my funeral those were some of the thought i clearly remember from back then so i went back to my place started researching everything related to my medical result the med i wa taking and the symptom i wa having while i wa researching that a friend noticed i wa online and asked if i would be interested in working for his company a an seo copywriter he wanted my reply within the next week and i said i am definitely interested but i needed to check something else out first the pay offered for the job wa enough for me to live independently again but that would only be possible if i solved my other issue after two day i decided that i am going to just stop taking my med cold turkey i needed to start working in week but my next specialist appointment wa a month and a half away i could not hope to work for him in the mental state i wa in under those med so i basically decided to take that huge huge risk if i could have gotten an appointment sooner to start gradual med removal properly i would have there wa just no other option at the time i would either miss my chance with that job and continue being in that miserable state or risk going cold turkey with med that have altered my brain chemistry and finally start moving forward again i still think i wa really lucky because i do not notice any long term consequence of going cold turkey like that but i would never ever recommend something like that to anyone if there is another option brain chemistry balance is nothing to fuck around with my desire to move forward just outweighed the related risk at the time i wa right other than feeling that same overwhelming fatigue if i push myself too hard none of the other symptom showed up again life wa ok for a while i had enough to live by myself i found a new girlfriend but it all did not last for long first that seo copywriter job wa soul sucking my friend just saw a chance took it made good money initially and then tried expanding too much too fast he started asking more and more for the same money and he got into trouble this is also something that got me into trouble down the road in any case his paypal account got blocked and he could not pay out the worker from my country and asked if anyone could help him transfer the fund i offered my help since he wa a major part of what got me moving again in life he transferred some fund onto my private bank account i split those fund and sent them to the other worker a requested everyone seemed happy and that wa the end of that it wa not that is the first decision i regret month later his company start failing and he cut our pay drastically i am talking about a cut then he start looking for workforce in other cheaper country and try to get me to still write and train new people i bail out and quit not wanting to push myself over the edge again despite the local economy being absolute shit and no job being in sight i just valued my health more at the time i could deal with living with my parent for a while again a long a i did not have any health issue a month after i moved back in with my parent i start feeling lump under my tongue several of them small round very hard for the first time in almost a year i go visit my doctor i do some test tumor confirmed malignant a in bad not sure if that is the correct term cancer basically but my doctor wa not done with delivering bad news turn out i did not have any kind of health insurance anymore and she did not know why the next day i managed to find out why i lost my health insurance turn out our law and regulation were even more fucked up than i wa aware of since i wa oficially unemployed working a an seo copywriter for my friend turned out to be a grey job so to speak and the unemployment bureau kept track of my bank account it got auto flagged the moment a suspiciously large sum of money wa deposited in it you only get classified a an unemployed person until you reach a certain average monthly income quota which they track over your bank account i went over that average the moment my friend paycheck money wa deposited on my account now here is the catch the bureau ha no obligation to ask about such transaction or notifiy you if they take you down from the unemployment list their default course of action is to remove you from their unemployment stats after all they have one le unemployed person to worry about it is a win for them you can have health insurance even if you are unemployed in this country but when they take you off the unemployment list you have to apply for health insurance again within a certain time period or you lose it until you find a job so i did not know i wa no longer an officially unemployed person i did not apply for health insurance again in time and i lost it i needed to have tumor removal surgery a soon a possible but i had no health insurance i did not have even close to enough saved up either we eventually make a contract for payment over a period of year and i do the surgery i told the entire situation to the friend that got me into that mess and he said he will see what he can do he offer to lend me some money it wa not even a th of what i needed to pay for surgery but my whole family wa pretty much bankrupt at that point and i accepted that is the second decision i regret we agreed that i will start paying him back a soon a i get a job the sum wa about in local currency it is been almost year since then i still do not have a job i have applied to almost a hundred job in that time period only got a reply for job of those job i got stiffed for pay on a in i did not get any pay for month while the third wa a heavy construction job with work hour where i literally ended up pissing blood middle of summer doc said it wa dehydration and quitting the same day it happened i lasted week there at least i got health insurance again the friend that lent me about he is now threatening me with legal charge and loan shark he is also in debt and apparently started doing drug so i actually consider him dangerous right now he started threatening that he will show up at my parent house i do not know what the hell i am going to do if he doe that i am not on good term with my father but my parent are still my parent if he show up or threatens them in anyway i am afraid that i wo not be able to control myself i literally have not been able to pay him a single cent back in the last year i have nothing and have had nothing in the past year the pitiful amount of money that i managed to earn all went straight into paying bill for my parent since my father is still unemployed i am basically dead weight for my parent my sister is helping u all out but she is expecting a second child soon and there is no way she can help me i have not met with any of my friend for over a year and a half not even for a beer or coffee i just ca not afford it most of them are in their own pile of shit too with the national economy being in the dumpster a for my girlfriend well she ca not help me either she life in another country and there is nationality issue due to there being a civil war over here year ago her parent are absolutely opposed to her relationship with me but she love me to bit and i love her too and just to make everything even more absurd she is living within a couple of mile of an uncle who molested her when she wa a child around year old she wa also raped by a group of stranger unrelated to her uncle during an evening walk when she wa year old god i wish i wa making this all up i am not sure what is the point in even writing all this down i just do not know what else to do writing it all down for others to see is the only thing i have not done yet and now i am here where i am now nowhere again stuck in full blown despair again but also angry now so angry at so many people and i have no idea if i can control it all much longer so i am just scared i will either hurt others or hurt myself or hurt others and then myself i have no idea what i should do anymore this time i simply do not see any opportunity in sight i keep applying for local job and no one reply

-48.976414,20.112535,the more i am awake the more i think about ending it that is the gist of it anyway i feel like i ca not go anywhere with my problem anymore because i will always be looked at like a whiny little bitch or something i work a pretty shitty job dealing with swarm of asshole on a daily basis that is to say i am a gas station attendant and people treat me like scum at first i grinned and bore it but now i dread going into work i am burnt out on it i used to be polite and talkative but in the last week especially i feel like that part of me is not around anymore it seems a though r relationship advice wa right about the girl i wa crushing on she wa only leading me on she is probably spending the night at her boyfriend is right now she told me last night that she did not want to hurt my feeling but i do not believe that in the slightest i have slowly turned into a misogynist which i never wanted almost every woman i meet and befriend i feel a if i ca not trust and yet the majority of my friend are woman i have some guy friend but a lot of them are rather annoying and definitely overstay their welcome i can feel myself becoming more and more antisocial a the day go on to the point where my ex girlfriend told me that she feel a if she never even happened to me to give you a summary of that i dated a girl i know from canada for about four or five month she helped to pull me up from my dark little hole but then we stopped talking for a while and finally broke up she told me tonight that i am an asshole because i apparently make it out so that my feeling are the only one that matter and maybe i am that way but i feel so victimized all the time i know that we all have to climb our own mountain and i just ca not help but vent about how my voyage must be harder than everyone else is because i am experiencing it even though i know that others have it harder and i have little right to complain i feel a though i am overstaying my welcome too and since i have pretty much all ready decided to eliminate myself from the gene pool because i am convinced that i will never find someone who life up to what i want i have been considering taking myself out of the game entirely i have been thinking of a whole variety of different method while toying with the idea of just seeking help from a professional even though past attempt with professional have been fruitless i honestly do not believe that there is anyone who can help me but i am hoping,suicidality

-29.184072,71.23565,i am feeling ill and it is getting worse for each day hi i guess i do not know how to do this i posted in depression but maybe i should have posted here i have been depressed for nearly year now and you know it ha been worse suicidal and slightly better there wa a time for a couple month i thought that maybe life wa worth living but it came crashing down again and i ca not realy blame myself i wa not worth enough to have such feeling i do not think i ever wa so i guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lot of problem still lingering from it and one of my firends when we were out at a pub he is been my friend for like year now he said about my father i can understand why he remaried with someone with child cause he knew he would fucked up with you and wanted to try start over again and i guess that is true cause all he did wa to put my sister and i infront of the tv or computer though my mother wa not that good either she put me infront of a book good made me scary litterate a a kid but she always had a bad temper like a hellish scream i never heard before and she is very controlling so that wa not that great either both had to work alot to get thing going for them so i guess i did not really spend that much quality time with my family so i waited for my time to leave and then moved out and today i try to never visit home because i always feel bad when i am there and i have been kinda suicidal lately i remember someone asked me if i wa ok and only slept bad i kinda then proceeded to do a i always do and push those asking away i do not want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how i feel but i think it is not right i think i will try and talk with her about something but i do not know how to ask how should i bring it up that i want to talk about something should i do that wo not they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing worse than to be surprised than me taking my life and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything is it right to burden others with the weight of your thought especially since you meet them and word could spread i wish i could cry in front of someone and be hugged i wish i could talk to my friend and tell her how i feel and that i need someone to talk to but i am not quite sure she could take it or help me is it ok to talk to someone is it ok to share what i feel like looking for some sort of comfort can i find comfort in this by talking or will i just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again can i risk talking to anyone about this is it right of me to press something on someone is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what i am feeling and my suicidal thought,suicidality
6.2563224,-32.43889,lost never posted here before or even on reddit but at this point i think even talking to stranger might help i just do not see a point to living quite honestly it seems like everything i try to do fails and everything that make me happy is taken away nearly a soon a i obtain it i feel like one giant fuck up and it make me want to give up i am lucky enough to have an awesome boyfriend and a beautiful dog and there are a lot of other fantastic people in my life that i love but i do not want to burden others with my problem or feeling i do not think it is fair and i do not want to drag them down with me my boyfriend doe not know how to deal with me when i am upset and i do not blame him for that i guess what is getting me down the most is money i hate it but i need it to live i just got a job after a month rest which i had hoped would help me feel better but i do not know if i will get enough hour to even pay rent what i really hate is that i go to work to make money so that i can live to go to work to make money that is not the kind of life i want it is meaningless and joyless to me but there are so few thing that actually bring me joy anyways even if i had an endless pool of money i do not think i could be happy there is nothing that i want in life i have no aspiration or goal even if i did i do not have the fund to achieve them and what is the point of doing anything if some day i am just going to die anyways it is not like i can take stuff with me and i doubt i will ever have kid to carry on my memory i am a nobody anyways when i am gone i will just be gone i have no immediate plan to kill myself but the thought cross my mind on a daily basis honestly if i did not know how crushed my family and boyfriend would be i probably would have done it by now i am miserable but that doe not give me the right to pas it on to others not sure what point i am trying to make or who i am trying to reach out to i guess i just wanted to vent but hey maybe someone ha advice or something i know i am not the only one who feel this way,suicidality
