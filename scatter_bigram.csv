-25.596682,-23.517323,i am officially scared this turned out longer than i expected but please bare with me i have not tried sharing my feeling like this in a long time ad i refuse to re read and edit it a i know i will choose to omit thing and never get it out anyway i would say that my life is not anything like i thought it would be at this point but honestly i did not think i would make it this far alive ironically even in my current position i can say that marijuana helped keep me alive now i think it is consuming my life when i first started i wa freshly suffering from mdd gad and some pretty damn bad ptsd who know what else my wonderful genuinely awesome psychiatrist would have diagnosed me with had i not lost my insurance these were all problem i knew i had but dis not have the chance to seek help until i wa i have rage issue that came from this bizarre mix and severe night terror related to my ptsd smoking fixed all of this a first it wa fun i smoked with a couple coworkers then my aunt and boyfriend they decided to start again after i started first it wa recreation but then i noticed the symptom to most of my problem were dissolving after a while i could say i had not had a night terror in month had not given in to the urge to hurt myself nearly a often a cycle of self hatred that had started when i wa maybe and in general my mood wa not quite so bad i felt like i could finally cope with my anxiety none of my friend who are more like family to me due to my life situation ever smoked in high school we never partied we never drank we never got into trouble for complicated reason we lost touch after high school while living in the same small town my boyfriend and i were both smoking every day and when i got back in touch with my old friend the closest of them had started smoking a well i felt like we were able to reconnect and bond over this plant and it wa great at first at this point i wa a high functioning stoner and most people would have no idea save for those who knew me it did not get bad until i wa i just ended a year relationship mostly due to my inability to cope with the stress of my life then i lost all control i wa in a dark place i do not want to talk about i became a zombie even during work for a while i became passive apathetic i had escaped i barely even realized a whole summer had been spent alone on my xbox not even by choice my friend had gone off into their own little world whether it be their choice in partner or be it their worrying need to literally spend month alone without human contact this being a friend who had yet to start smoking with no boyfriend friend that had gone mia before they started smoking heavily i got pretty lost a lot of bad thing happened to me many of them thing i had no control over and almost a many because i had finally escaped myself and given up after my dad got into some legal trouble i got clean again but then my friend came back they were i right behind them and we three became the best of friend again fast forward to now when i am almost friend one who wa always straight edge a fuck ha become a fiend for bud it used to help her medically but i see what i call reefer madness in her eye when she talk about getting low she started abusing her prescription pill and ha turned on me in a very aggressive way only hydro addict can i imagine and i have forgiven her she is only back on them again for the third time after fighting through withdrawal to get clean after going to jail because she attacked her husband after she had gotten holocaust thin friend number two always ha had social anxiety and loved smoking with me at first now a couple year later the withdrawn one is again withdrawn acting strange distant and mean towards me refusing to open up coming home in the verge of tear and obviously upset refusing to talk to me but then being suddenly fine after smoking and still dropping the issue people that used to be my best friend do not even reach out to me first anymore but get mad if i do not reach out first often enough unless they want to find a bag i live out of town now with friend two actually friend one actually got extremely upset with me because i wanted to spend my day off visiting family and friend instead of going around to my old contact and buying her a bag i have so many old friend that just do not feel like friend anymore i feel more lonely than i ever have in my life friend two is brother is my current boyfriend and while he used to smoke every day with me a well he quit for a while and smoke infrequently even when he is in the room with u i keep my rage and anxiety down with smoking but now i think i use it to cope with how it is affecting everyone around me i do know a few people who smoke medically and they benefit without hardly any negative life altering side effect my boyfriend bless his heart still insists that while i use it often i do not get aggressive about getting low i do not start breaking down if i had a long day and need a bowl and well he basically is just saying that i am one of those people that benefit more than they are hurt by it he is not seeing me act the way most of my friend are and he doe not believe that for my or others sake i need to quit currently not seeing a shrink or paying for smoke so there are the two biggest negative factor there but he doe see where i am coming from when i say i want to quit to not only prove that i can but to see if i can say with certainty that i am not like them i feel personally that weed ha had few negative side effect i want to give my lung a break and start learning how to meditate and truly be happy my problem is that i do feel dependent on marijuana to take place of the psychiatrist and therapy that i desperately need i am very scared of my night terror returning i know a hypnotherapist who will see me for free and they are the kind of people who would just not smoke around me if i asked them not to so i am not worried about them my problem the point i am having such a hard time getting out because i have not hd anyone to really talk to about this no privacy with boyfriend either a we have cramped living quarter right now okay my point is that for one reason or the other i know i have to quit at least for now i have been weaning myself off smoking le every day and our supply is running out i refuse to spend money i do not have even if it is for what i consider medicine because i did not always get it for free i do not want to be broke but my closest friend cannot even function at a fucking wedding without sneaking off to smoke i do not want to be around this anymore but these people are like my family i am scared i am more like them than either myself or my boyfriend are perceiving i basically realized that in order to get out of this terrible addictive lifestyle i have to get away from the people who have turned toxic in my life i am so sorry this wa so confusing but thank you someone if anyone read this i desperately wished someone who knew my situation could talk to me about this my shrink even believed that i would be better once my life got more stable and calmed down that it wa not all my brain being mi wired that led to my extreme depression and anxiety that wa before all this heavy shit i just these people are like my family i am so scared of being alone i really am scared that if i get out of the smoker lifestyle i will find myself in a very lonely place that i have not yet learned to cope with i need a doctor badly but i really need a friend my boyfriend and i have had some problem but mostly because we never are alone and i do not get private time to talk to him besides that he is on the inside tl dr halp c,addiction

-27.142647,-44.470974,i have finally realized that i have a real problem and my only option is to not drink i have been toying with this idea for year i have not gone to bed without having a drink for year it ha progressively gotten worse like a snake slithering up my body at first it felt cool against my skin but the grip ha gotten tighter and tighter and now i am panicking this realization occurred when i woke up with the shake on the morning of my wedding with a panicked feeling that there wa no vodka or mini bar in my hotel room and i did not drive to the hotel and had no way to get vodka before my bridal party showed up i stupidly drank the vodka i had hid in my bag the night before i racked my brain to try to figure out how i could get any alcohol in my system and how i could continue getting alcohol in my system all day my husband and i agreed that we were not really going to drink on our wedding day so we could remember the day we spent a year planning and k on and i told my bridal party a well that wa stupid then i remembered there wa leftover champagne from the morning before it wa warm but i certainly did not care that morning i hurriedly drank an entire bottle of warm champagne in the minute between when my husband left my hotel room and when my bridesmaid started showing up i also filled up hotel cup with champagne and hid them in the bathroom behind toilet paper roll so i could drink throughout the day so i could keep the shake and sweat at bay i also ended up drinking the champagne my bridesmaid brought at my first look with my husband i had consumed about two and a half bottle of champagne throughout the day and did not even really feel drunk a we walked into our wedding venue i wa not thinking about the amazing commitment i wa making to the man of my dream i wa thinking about what excuse i could make to go back on our promise i told my husband i wanted to have just one before our ceremony cuz i wa nervous about saying my vow in front of everyone ok me too and we had our first drink of the night a i wa waiting to hear the song i picked to walk down the aisle to i wa not thinking about the people who had come from all over the country to celebrate this new chapter of my life i wa thinking about what my next excuse could be for my next drink i wa the bride i could not sneak off anywhere to get a drink i wa cursing myself for not somehow hiding a pocket shot somewhere a i am walking down the aisle i think to myself oh i will just have my bridesmaid slip me a drink of vodka on ice no one will know eyeroll and my mind is calmed a my father in law is tearfully giving his speech about how grateful they are to have me joining his family all i can think about is how to get someone to come over and refill my glass of champagne without people noticing sipping on the glass of vodka that appears to the sea of people to be water and my mind flash to what i have been thinking for so long i am a fraud i am worthless i have no self control i am now starting to feel drunk oops took it too far luckily at this point everyone at my wedding that ha a very open bar and very heavy pourers is trashed it is now minute til last call hmm how do i get one more drink i ask the best man if he is done his wedding shot of the night oh gosh he ha not well we ca not not join them now to the afterparty and i feel so relieved relieved i did not black out at my wedding relieved that i do not think anyone noticed i wa a bit drunk relieved i only got a bit drunk our wedding venue wa byob so on our way out we grab a bottle of jameson and ketel one from the bar to bring back to the room just in case someone want to keep it going after the afterparty the afterparty is over and my husband is passed out in bed i open the bottle of vodka and take two shot and fall asleep the next morning the cycle start again but this time i have hidden some of the vodka in the bathroom start my morning with two shot to roll into another boozy brunch in celebration of u my husband ca not drink because he is a doctor and ha to work the next day more mimosa for me boozy brunch roll into a celebratory dinner with his family filled with martini husband is still not drinking why ca not i have my husband is ability to say no rolled into a recovery brunch the next day with my bridesmaid preempted by two shot of vodka at home to get thing started three day post wedding a day filled with sweat and shake call in sick to work drink some cider to take the edge off i am now day post wedding and have not been sober for a full day yet today is the day inside my bottle of vodka is shame fear regret pain hopelessness outside my bottle of vodka is a beautiful life full of possibility love future child hope and success i do not know what i am going to do about the fact that our life is filled with alcohol revolves around alcohol that we have paid for an all inclusive honeymoon in jamaica where the alcohol flow freely that we have a trip with his parent to wine country planned i do not know what i am going to do about explaining to my husband that i sold him a false bill of good that i am not a successful moderate drinker

-77.50978,-25.308235,tuesday will be two month sober it is also my birthday some thought i have not posted on this sub a whole lot but i want to thank everyone in this community i wa so glad i found this sub the day after i decided to stop drinking it wa a massive help especially in the very early day now on day when i am feeling the urge i find myself browsing the sub to reinforce my will to stay sober i feel like no matter how much you have read how many story you have heard or how much advice you have been given it is hard to really prepare for what early sobriety is going to be like it is definitely held a fair share of surprise for me most of the experience up to this point ha been positive but i would be lying if i said that everything ha been perfect since i stopped drinking the first week wa tough going through withdrawal while at work those first few day hand shaking trouble concentrating almost feeling like you are looking at the world cross eyed through fog my appetite started coming back almost immediately but i found that i could not really eat much other than really mild food to begin with i wa waking up every hour at night going to work completely exhausted just looking forward to a time when i would be able to get a good night is sleep i felt almost hung over for the first week or so psychologically those first two week were both the hardest and easiest part of the journey so far i wa dealing with constant craving and having to remind myself to change routine and habit constantly trying to retrain my brain to stop associating absolutely everything with alcohol but i also had a zealousness within me that kept me motivated to keep going i think that telling this sub along with some of my closest friend that i wa quitting helped further that commitment by making me accountable if no one had known that i decided to quit no one would have known if i failed it probably only took about a week and a half for me to start sleeping well the night sweat that i had gotten so used to went away the first time i slept four hour without waking up wa a surprising incredible gift it wa one of the first physiological affirmation that i should keep going so many of the health problem from drinking are insidious and almost intangible i used to be able to ignore so many of them on a daily basis by convincing myself that they were just normal then i started to realize other change were happening shake that i would get later in the day before getting off work that i used to think were from low blood suger i do not eat much while i am at work gradually went away a my body stopped needing alcohol to function i wa just like well shit apparently my body wa just starting to go through withdrawal every day at work it is been such a blessing to see my productiveness at work go up along with the quality of my work using my hand is an important part of my job and looking back it wa kinda crazy how many thing i had to do on a regular basis to compensate for having shaky hand my sugar craving went through the roof after i quit drinking an obscene amount of ice cream candy and soda wa consumed those first few week i still have not been able to get rid of the soda habit i know i need to switch to sparkling water the amount of cigarette i have been smoking ha also increased but i still count everything a a net win maybe i will give an e cig a try to stop smoking being able to eat and appreciate food again ha been amazing to begin with i had high expectation for losing weight after a few week i just decided to stop stressing out too much about it being sober wa and still is the most important thing sobriety can be my jumping off place for other area of self improvement without sobriety self improvement just would not be much of an option even with a le than stellar diet i have noticed a bit of weight loss my skin also look better my hair is still grey a ever sometimes i do find myself missing going to the bar with friend i am so grateful that none of those that i considered to be close friend have tried to break down my willpower they just accepted my choice and moved on i am still trying to figure out exactly how to go about socializing without alcohol the bar wa the focal point of social interaction for so long even when i would just get together with some guy to play video game it always involved drinking some day i hope to get to the point where i can accompany other people to a bar and feel confident in my ability to turn down drink for now i know i am not there i have become something of a shut in the last two month spending most of my time reading playing video game watching movie etc reading wa an amazing way to keep my mind off of drinking during the first few week despite seeing people le i can tell overall my mental state ha improved mood swing have been more common but they also have not been near a extreme a they were while i wa drinking some day i find myself laughing easily others i find myself feeling grumpy about everything no longer do i feel either insanely happy and outgoing or incredibly angry and sad my emotion have been much more middle of the road thought of self harm have also been nearly non existant i find myself both cursing and praising sobriety when it come to sleep i miss being able to just flop down in bed close my eye and be completely out now it is not unusual for me to get distracted by reddit and stay up for hour later than i should have yet even on the day when i only get four hour of sleep i still feel more rested than i ever did while i wa drinking anxiety about going to bed still creep in regularly when i wa still drinking i had pretty well set parameter around going to bed all of them were in place to make sure i did not drink too much and become completely nonfunctional at work the next day now i have to remind myself that i am not going to wake up hung over the next day regardless of how late i go to bed waking up in the morning is still something of a surprise it is a constant reminder of why sobriety is the right path that i hope never completely go away aside from the first week week have probably been the most difficult for me one of my best friend moved away which took it emotional toll it became harder to remind myself of why i should stay sober the further away from the detrimental side effect that i got thankfully even with the craving coming pretty regularly my new habit and routine took over and kept carrying me home without much thought also just not wanting to disappoint people that care about me helped more than any of those people probably know the money i have saved the last two month ha been a constant tangible source of strength coming home from work and being able to set aside most of my tip money ha been great i wa able to look down at a wad of a cash and be like sobriety ha saved me this much money so far last week i spent that money and am now typing this post from a newly built pc having a goal in mind for what i wanted to purchase wa also a great tool for keeping myself strong anyways sorry for the wall of text thank you everyone for all you do in this community i will not

sponsorship lot of meeting a consistent homegroup and the fellowship i have been sober since july a i write this i have been sober nearly a decade i can hardly believe that coming from where i came from let me start at the beginning the beginning i grew up in the western u in a middle class family i wa the eldest of sibling and certainly not the most popular kid in school both my parent drank and later went on to develop severe alcohol and drug addiction a a side i do believe alcoholism is a family disease however them being alcoholic did not cause me to be alcoholic more of a predisposition my sister is not alcoholic and plenty of people from non alcoholic family become alcoholic in high school i remember having a difficult time finding a friend group one week it wa the nerdy guy who played video game and raced remote control car another week it wa the jock and the week after that the popular guy and gal sometimes i would hang out with people from my neighborhood i did not fit in i did not feel anything like other people looked i thought that if they really knew me they would hate me just a much a i hated me that all changed at halfway through that freshman year a friend that lived down the road asked if i wanted to try drinking not a week before that i had tried marijuana for the first time i agreed to try drinking with my friend my grandfather lived near u and had stockpile of beer in his fridge he wa also an alcoholic we devised a plan to steal one of his pack of beer he had probably other pack and we thought he probably would not notice we easily swiped a pack and got it out of his house we went down by the river i still remember the taste of that first beer milwaukee is best i drank of them and the magic happened i felt on top of the world i finally fit in with a group of friend my fear fell from me and i wa able to come out and play i had fun we ran around laughing and acting crazy it wa one of the best experience i have ever had progression from that first experience i wa hooked i told myself only on the weekend that lasted a few month until some opportunity presented themself to drink during the week i drank a much a i could a often a i could my grade suffered a bit but it wa worth it my parent found out after a little while and they were not pleased they were only starting to have problem with drug and alcohol themselves at this time by the second year of high school my drinking had entered a second stage i started skipping school and going to house party i would often ask homeless people to buy me booze i wa stealing wine and malt liquor from grocery store aside from some trouble at school and subpar grade i had very little consequence at this time but something wa happening alcohol wa no longer an occasional thing i did for fun but a necessity the bleak end by the time i wa thing had gotten out of hand i skipped school so much i decided i ought to drop out i got a high school equivalent and began working this only increased my drinking now i had several thousand dollar and all the time after work to drink although this is an aa subreddit i will say i used a lot of marijuana a well i experimented with a few other drug my friend offered me at party but overall alcohol wa my lifeblood i began waking in the morning craving drug and alcohol i would be angry when i realized i wa sober in the morning it wa no longer o clock after work drink and weekend binder i would drink in the morning i decided to quit my job they did not respect me besides i had saved several thousand dollar which would last me a while i would go to city college that will solve my problem however in a few month i wa a bad a ever i convinced myself to stop going to my class and drink to oblivion i felt so alone and desolate the last few month of my drinking i ran out of money i would beg my mom that i wa still living with for money just enough to get by when she would not give me money i would steal it out of her purse i hated myself i hated drinking it wa not working i needed something different i knew that if something did not change i wa going to end up in jail dead or even worse keep drinking for another few

-31.563503,-22.379143,a poor morning and a confirmation a bit of a creative nonfiction essay i have been doing well for awhile now have not been drinking for day and before the full sober start i would minimized and moderated down successfully but i would arrived at a point at which i realized that alcohol is not adding any value to my life and in reality it wa starting to take thing away so i stopped altogether and felt great it wa not a struggle and the time i had an urge i just re directed my mind and body yesterday a long time friend reached out to me i do not see him often anymore but we go way back to undergrad and have been friend for many year our social circle of course wa steeped in various form of substance use and let is be honest abuse the behavior appeared normalized but looking back now most of the social circle at the college i went to probably were not into the same type of thing we were i do not regret those time a i learned a lot about myself and how human interact socially but i do not live in those time anymore in any event when he reached out to me i thought to myself let is have this be a test so he came over after work and we drank he like to drink and if i am being fair i certainly have spent my own share of time enjoying drinking he doe not make my choice i do so we drank it wa not the most we have ever had together i remember the whole night i interspersed some water we had food our conversation wa cogent but we drank my wife came home not long after he arrived and she hung out with u for a bit i would been feeding my month old son and a little while after she got home we put him to bed i would briefly gone outside with my buddy before that and we shared a cigarette i do not smoke i do not like cigarette i only smoke them when i am drinking with this particular buddy i would washed my hand and face before helping with bedtime but of course my wife still smelled it and i am sure my son likely noticed it too i wanted to get back downstairs to keep talking with my friend and a little bit of a flicker went through my mind what is more important here bullshitting with my buddy some more over another beer or being with my son and wife at bedtime we read him a story somewhat quickly maybe too quickly and then my wife finished putting him to bed i went back downstairs and continued on with my buddy my wife came down shortly after and we ate some delivery dinner my wife eventually went to bed my buddy and i went outside to the front porch and continued drinking we had a good conversation largely based on the grad school program i am currently in and some of it subject matter eventually it got fairly late for a weeknight and my friend left i brought in the unfinished but opened beer and dumped them out i cleaned up a bit in the kitchen and then went to bed all seemed well this morning i woke up with the worst hangover i have had in month i am still hurting pretty bad a i type this i have had some breakfast and have kept that down had water and gatorade and some ibuprofen and i have been working but boy do i feel unwell and i woke up later than normal about a half hour my wife wa not pleased with me the morning routine ran late because i overslept she missed her normal bus i dropped the kiddo off at daycare a bit later than normal my wife and i recently started doing some relationship counseling not because of me or drinking but because we have agreed there are some mutual thing we need to work out and improve a she left for the next bus this morning she made it clear she wa none too happy with how the morning had gone shortly thereafter she texted me that she feel like the day after my buddy come over are always a mess that if i am hungover it throw off the morning routine and she end up running late she is not wrong i rarely see my buddy anymore this is not a common occurrence and typically when i do i see him i go over to his place but still she is not wrong my first reaction wa to want to go tit for tat with her to say isorry but here is some thing that you do that make me resentful and blah blah blah and by the way you did not have to change our son is diaper and get him dressed you could have said you needed to catch the next bus and i could have continued getting him ready like i normally do sure i wa hungover but i wa not incapacitated but i did not say that i just apologized on the way to work i steamed a bit to myself about some of her fault and how she ha a talent for making a lot of thing more difficult than they need to be but i did not lash out hopefully thing will be smoother and we can talk about it a bit tonight and move on i can say one thing for certain though friend i am done with alcohol i care about my buddy he is had his own struggle a messy divorce right after the birth of his own kid perhaps somewhat due to his own unwillingness to address his poorer habit like immoderate drinking and cigarette but if not drinking mean i do not really see him anymore then unfortunately so be it the self test wa finished and the result are in booze ha zero value for me anymore drowned nostalgia is worthless i will not drink with you

-23.45726,-6.20432,a few thought on the what to tell other people question happy friday one of the thing i have found most interesting about sd is the volume of question and comment that are at least tangentially related to what if someone asks me if i do not drink in a social situation i thought i would share my take a someone who get asked it a lot between a drink friendly work environment and hanging out at bar a lot i say this a a neurotic clinically anxious overly sensitive person who care way too much about what others think of me i will usually be honest with a few caveat which i explain below and the question doe not phase me anymore in fact it is sort of a good conversation piece honest in this case ha a bit of explanation because i do not say oh i am an alcoholic even though that is certainly true i will use the a word around friend who know me well and can appreciate the nuance of what the term alcoholic mean a it relates to me but it ha too much cultural baggage for me to use that term self descriptively around people that i am not very close with people do not really think about you a much a you would think and of the time i do not drink elicits a shrug and a subject change not an interrogation and not because the asker is uncomfortable but because they just do not give a shit fine with me it is not a particularly interesting part of my existence for the other of the time when people ask some variation of why not part of me think that almost everyone who asks a followup is on conversation autopilot and pretty much instantly regret it regardless i usually use some variation of it just doe not agree with me which is exactly the case or already drank my lifetime supply i really like that one a it is lighthearted while subtly sending a message that maybe insisting come ooonnnn just have one drink with me might not be a great idea if they are really pressing it i do not mind saying i thought i drank too much and it is easier for me to just not drink at all a funny thing i have noticed is that people really only pry when they are a little worried about their own drinking habit and maybe a tad curious or maybe envious about how you did it i am not out to judge or change anyone else is drinking habit but if someone asks about the process of quitting indirectly or directly maybe it is a chance to help a always ymmv but in my experience these thing are often much bigger deal in your head than they are in other people,alcoholism

thinking about who i wa when i wa drinking but it is something i have to do to make sure that i know what is at stake this is long but i kept thinking of thing to add to the list so since june nd i have lost pound today is the first day i weighed in at pound lighter i made a before after post on facebook and it wa hard to look at picture of myself before my face wa greasy and puffy my eye were bloodshot and you can just see how shitty i felt both emotionally and physically i am doing well in school i somehow managed to get into arguably the best program in the united state and maybe even the world for what i do i am in an admittedly small field so the chance of admission are higher but i am quite proud of my accomplishment it ha been difficult i have had little to no free time and i have had set back but i have been told by some huge name that i am doing really well in their class i do have to remind myself that they mean what they are saying they are not just being nice because i destroyed my self confidence with drinking i could barely think nine month ago and my mental faculty were not entirely back by the time i started this program i am still not sure they are completely back or if they ever will be but this ha shown me what i can accomplish and what i can get through if i put my mind to it i have been broken up with i am not entirely sure of the word i would use since we were not an official item but we had been on a few date and had even kissed woah either way i thought i really liked him he called it off because he said there wa not any chemistry nine month ago i would have been desolate i would have decided that i would be alone for the rest of my life and that this wa my one chance to find love this time i told him that upon retrospection i agree and we amicably parted way i have been around alcohol i wa not sure how i would ever manage to be around alcohol again but important event in my field often involve reception with drink afterwards this is where you mingle with influential people so you ca not just opt out of these reception i have been offered drink repeatedly people always forget that i do not drink which is fair i have not made a big deal out of it and have turned them down every single time some situation are more difficult than others but it is getting easier especially because i have confided in two friend in my program and they keep an eye out for me speaking of friend i have made new friend and become a better friend to my old one i am more comfortable around people while i am still really anxious and nervous around new people i am not afraid to be genuinely myself a i am no longer hiding my friend have been amazing and stuck by me while i constantly fucked up due to my drinking i absolutely do not begrudge the people that did not stick around and i am in awe of the people that did i have been able to help them in return and am more capable of being there for them like i should have been this whole time i have pushed myself one of my hobby includes a lot of physical fortitude it is called body suspension i have posted picture of it before but only look if you are okay with blood i used to have such a hard time with it and really struggled every time including lot of cry now i am able to calm myself and ease into it and have accomplished some really difficult suspension i have stopped hiding from event in the community because i wa too scared to be away from alcohol for extended period of time i am getting to know some amazing people through this shared passion i have new hobby i have taken up knitting and have come a long way since i started in july i knit every night to calm myself before bed and am now proficient in a lot of technique i have even started commissioning work mostly because i could not afford to buy my own yarn anymore lol i used to love baking and i am getting back into it i have even been able to bake some thing that i have always wanted to try but thought were too difficult i broke my arm this wa not fun but i am proud of how i handled it i did cry when i fell but i still laughed and joked i wa in a new town had just moved ten day before and had just barely met my new friend who were so amazing through this i had two surgery and took only a responsible amount of pain killer although i did make my dad hold onto the bottle until we both felt comfortable i wa so stressed and had a lot of work ahead of me to get back to normal well normal ish my arm will never be able to extend all the way again i did not sink into myself i did not start drinking to cope with it i did not even get tempted by the pain medication i worked through it i have stopped hiding i am sure most people here can relate you go home from party with friend board game night dinner etc early because you do not want anyone to see how much you drink or you are ashamed of how you acted when you were drunk so you disappear from your friend for a while well i no longer need to do that i still sometimes need to leave event early because of my anxiety but i can be honest about it outside of my professional environment i am also honest about the reason i am not drinking i am not ashamed of who i am but i am still embarrassed by who i wa most importantly i have failed i have had project fall flat i have missed deadline not everyone like me i have failed to read everything i need to i have had to leave event because i ca not handle the amount of people these are thing that i ca not always control but i can handle it now it is not the end of the world i do not need to drink to

i do not even know if i can be accepted for anything even if i upgrade and if i am even smart and stable enough to be able to pas i work with a contractor at the moment and i am the only employee i do not always work every day it is more of a whenever he need my help type of job because his work is very unpredictable but when i do work it is full time hour and descent pay the problem is that i ca not really talk to my bos it is been month and i can barely hold a short conversation with him every once and a while and the rest of the time it is just awkward silence work actually seems so lonely and i want a job where i can at least try to talk to co worker like my other friend job i think i can talk to people who are my own age much easier than i can talk to older people so i think i might look for a job that might not be quite a depressing i am also terrified about if i can pas college and find a job in the future that i would not hate i hate that i have no skill or interest in any job i can think of which suck because i do not want to go through my life hating my job and where i have gone in life i also want to do something that might help people or make a change in the world but i the biggest thing on my mind and the thing that seems to be causing the most anxiety for me is relationship i fear that i will go through life and never be good enough to fall in love and have someone love me back i know if i were i would need to get over my anxiety gain some confidence and make something out of my life like get a good job and find someone who would somehow accept me for who i am i do not know why it is so important to me but my number one desire in life is to love someone and be loved back but even if i were to miraculously manage my anxiety and be able to talk to girl i would still have my low intelligence weird and sometimes childish sense of humor many many medical problem like blood sugar issue my foot problem that make it impossible and extremely tiring for me to run at all or walk long distance and my overall strangeness i do not think anyone could ever possibly be interested in me regardless of whether i have beaten my fear or not i know this is a weird thing to be thinking about being an year old male and i know many people go much longer without ever being in a relationship but i know it can probably never happen and it is the worst feeling ever regardless of all that though i have been making some small progress in talking to some people two of my closest friend that i can talk to i think because their sense of humor is weird like mine and i do not feel like they would judge me a much for talking and making silly joke do not live in the same city a me anymore so we hangout on skype almost everyday so recently one of them ha been inviting his new girlfriend and one of his school friend to talk with u and i have been able to talk to them fairly easily over skype i think it is easier because they know my friend and i am trying really hard to not be boring or afraid to talk and make joke because we have all go the same weird sense of humor hi girlfriend even called me and my other friend some of the most awesome people she is met so i hope i can continue on expanding my comfort zone in talking to people and hope it get somewhere,anxiety

self worth i can t explain it to my mother without confusing her and ultimately scaring her she s suffered from depression after my birth but she s not familiar with anxiety i completed the final presentation but i did not turn in my final paper the fact that i didn t turn in the final exam is tough to explain i wa going through a bad time and i waited beyond final i had final presentation due a week before the final paper i did not contact any of my professor offering any explanation what doe this look like to the outside if someone ha anxiety in my department they could recognize my behavior if i completed of my work but not the final which is one paper in each class then it s not a healthy sign it look like someone is crashing under the pressure what should i include in my essay i have to address an understanding of the circumstance and choice that led to required withdrawal how do i make the leap from what i actually did to how i m going to prepare differently to be honest i

-61.272156,64.25362,my advice to people suffering from nocturnal panic attack this is my first post on reddit so bear with me to start from about october of to december of i suffered from extreme nocturnal panic attack i would wake up in the middle of the night typically about hour after i had fallen asleep and would be having an all out panic attack more specifically i would be in complete and utter fear of being on the verge of insanity death and would eventually vomit some of the worst part were that i wa half asleep i would not know what had triggered the panic attack and i wa in complete darkness however after much personal research i came up with a hefty yet effective solution a nightly routine before i begin i should also mention that in the past i would wake up anywhere from time a night but would quickly fall back to sleep therefore after my th and final nocturnal panic attack i researched how to stay asleep and how to calm my anxious and panic provoking mind down before bed i will now go in depth about my routine i begin by plugging in my phone thirty minute before bed a study done by the national center for biotechnology information found that frequent use of cell phone around bedtime is associated with repeated awakening i want to stay asleep to help prevent these nocturnal attack not wake up the artificial light emitted from your cellphone simply convinces your body is internal clock that it is daytime resulting in repeated awakening i should also quickly mention that i try not to sleep next to my phone i plug it in across the room to prevent myself from mindlessly waking up and checking social medium text etc anyways the next step in my routine is to stretch i myself have found that stretching before bed unknowingly relaxes me next i layout my clothes then i continue my routine by inhaling lavender essential oil an oil that induces sleep this essential oil prof to be much more natural than sleep inducing substance such a nyquil or benadryl i will attach a link at the bottom with more information about lavender oil next i lay in bed and read a book until i naturally get sleepy finally i turn on an app known a rain and listen to exactly that rain this may sound strange to some but rain is a good example of white noise white noise creates a masking effect blocking out those sudden change that awaken light sleeper however it is important to note that this doe not include falling asleep to the television or fast paced music anyways this concludes my current routine that i still practice today all in all this basic routine that i have explored above enacts a powerful inner effect on my mind and body that it is time to sleep and stay asleep however in the very beginning of my self treatment i had a much longer routine simply because i wa much more fearful in the beginning i will now mention some additional habit i once had that helped me in the very beginning of my suffering in the past i would consume a sleep inducing mixture of ounce of warm milk teaspoon of honey and teaspoon of ground nutmeg i will provide a link to this mixed drink below that ha more information about each ingredient and it effect on the brain also before bed i would occasionally jog for minute when i faced unusual sum of fear that night this exercise would completely exhaust my body so much that it would not have the energy to flip on my flight or fight mode switch and would help to keep me at rest for the whole night however it is important to note that these extreme practice became unnecessary at a certain point in time they were simply my extreme solution to the overwhelming fear i faced in the very beginning of my struggle overtime due to my diminishing fear and the fact that i had not had a panic attack in so long i slowly began to let go of these practice each night i am proud to say that after starting the entirety of this routine i have not had one nocturnal panic attack since i hope this post find it way to any individual suffering from nocturnal panic attack or even a curious reader let me know if you have any question link cellphone before bed cause repeated awakening drink mixture lavender essential oil white noise more information on nocturnal panic attack,anxiety

-42.894474,21.25575,how to reduce self shame social anxiety is real name by saying something unexpected isocial anxiety is an unnecessarily technical sounding term for what is in reality self shame something at some point in a person is life caused them to see people a a threat it permanently lowered their self esteem a person may feel guilty ashamed or embarrassed without knowing why but there is a distinct reason what we call anxiety is a defense mechanism at some point in life an individual with social anxiety experienced something that brought their esteem down they were made fun of in a crowd their so cheated on them they made a mistake and were publicly admonished ridiculed while they may have suppressed that experience or forgotten about it every time they are among others they retreat into a shell they do not want to make a mistake or be noticed a a precaution against repeating the negative experience the racing heartbeat inside turning heavy breath the sheer panic that voice in your head screaming no do not talk to that person do not speak up do not open yourself up for an attack you need to embrace that sensation and overpower it you cannot wait for it to stop and disappear before you start approaching and interacting with people because chance are it will not go away possibly ever though it may diminish significantly over time when your heart is beating so fast that the vein in your neck are making your eye pop and you feel you might suffocate from panic say something silly like but tree do not have any pocket or make a funny noise you will get a snicker and a few what lol and at that moment your brain should realize you are not in any real danger it may sound silly but here is the science behind it seeing a smile and hearing laughter is a physical signal that will be interpreted by your brain body a a sympathetic gesture and defuse the major fight or flight response your body is currently having more on this later to overcome self shame or anxiety you must realize the worst that can happen and then scale back to where you are and the worst that can happen in that specific situation worst case scenario type of consequence imagine you are in a crowded theater on national television with your gf bf and parent watching you say or do something and the theater erupts with laughter and sneer your significant other call you worthless and start making out with someone right then and there your face is all over national television at this point you need to put thing in perspective you are famous maybe for the wrong reason but people still know of you you are free to see other people million of people out there quite a few with a good heart remember friday by that girl everyone made fun of rebecca black can you imagine the anxiety she must have felt when faced with such an overwhelmingly negative reaction being an internet meme joke what you probably did not hear is that she kept making song and is now laughing all the way to the bank just kidding it is direct deposit but whatever your situation you are in ask yourself is this the worst that could happen the answer is almost always no the level of danger interpreted by your brain decrease then ask yourself even if it wa are the consequence unbearable and am i in real physical danger again the answer is usually no if yes call police and the level of panic should subside a bit more now remember the fight or flight response we talked about earlier that is rooted in the sympathetic v parasympathetic nervous system the sympathetic system is fight or flight it nerve direct blood to the muscle and decrease blood supply to the gut it increase your heart rate and blood pressure this activates the body is immediate energy reserve to face the stressful state this is why people feel tired after a panic attack the parasympathetic system increase the blood supply to your digestive system and attempt to restore the body is energy reserve this is why i recommend saying something out of place by saying something out of place and silly you catch others off guard when a person is concentrated on something anything their brain is processing information relevant to that topic if it encounter information that ha absolutely nothing to do with the subject it trigger involuntary physical reaction creasing of the brow a slight smile a turning of the head for a moment it the brain doe not know what to do and neither doe the body this strategy is more for you the person with anxiety than for those around you when people are self absorbed in a story or an activity they do not exhibit sympathetic response they smile and nod le and if they do it is probably directed at someone else not you what you want to do is get people to exhibit friendly gesture specifically directed at you please do not confuse this strategy with wanting to direct all attention to you or anything like that this tactic simply trick people into exhibiting friendly i am not a threat gesture they may have otherwise forgotten about so that your brain can receive the all clear signal and relax people with high self esteem and confidence do not have self shame they do not see people a a threat and a such are neither looking for nor exhibiting sympathetic physical gesture they already feel at ease in their environment that may work for them but for people with self shame social anxiety who do see people a a threat need those physical indicator to reduce their anxiety here is why i do not recommend telling joke outright it is too much work for your already overloaded brain you are having a panic attack this is not the right time to worry about delivery and punchlines just blurting something silly out without thinking is far easier and more effective it is immediate so to recap ask yourself is this the worst case scenario answer no panic decrease ask yourself if it wa is it critical am i in danger answer no panic decrease blurt out something silly observe sympathetic response panic decrease again and should be at a manageable level you could also try initiating dialogue immediately after an anxiety episode remember that that is when your body is tired and probably doe not have the energy for more panic hope this help ad in response to some question and comment i have received in the past someone mentioned that pride stop them from blurting something random out pride is usually the manifestation of hidden shame or the relief that shame ha been avoided when people think a certain act will damage their pride dignity they are really saying that doing the act will bring with it the unpleasant feeling of shame or embarrassment in this case pride is the shield that protects the mind from being exposed to negative emotion on the other hand when one feel pride from accomplishing something they are feeling the relief of tension had they failed they would have felt shame they succeeded and avoided shame and instead are receiving praise the brain is thus feeling a relief of tension from the possibility of feeling shame pride often ha negative connotation in religious text because it is closely related or lead to arrogance and we can think of that a the belief that one cannot be shamed thus contradicting doctrine by placing the individual above god which society at the time did not approve someone mentioned that sneezing or saying something out of place increase their anxiety i would venture a guess that when people say something out of place the tension in the room increase and so doe their anxiety because people do not exhibit sympathetic signal yet their attention is focused on you this article on the feeling on being watched is a good read it explains that we are hardwired to know when we are being watched i interpret this a a survival mechanism you are trying to identify friend and foe now in modern society we have certain social norm you ca not fight foe and it is pretty awkward to flee a one would have in pre historic time this make your brain freak out even more because not only doe it feel threatened but because of education and upbringing it doe not see a viable response a way out you ca not scream fight run etc all you can do is sit and so the panic increase a sneeze turn others attention on him her and anxiety increase a sneeze is a sudden burst of sound and people instinctively glance to id the source a a possible threat when their brain catch up to the fact that it is just a sneeze they go back to what they are doing but and this is important that sudden sneeze that is out of place doe not lead people to exhibit sympathetic signal quite the opposite they exhibit hostile or guarded signal because for a split second they do not know the source or intention of the violent noise disturbance the key to saying doing something out of place to reduce anxiety is the following it must not be a surprise saying tree do not have pocket in a conversation about politics is odd maybe humorous but not surprising it is a conversation so people already expect you to say something just not that it must force natural sympathetic signal from people maybe the conversation is too serious or the people in it too istuck up for a joke or random saying to diffuse tension you have to evaluate the situation and choose the right thing to say do to force natural friendly signal to emerge smile laughter a nod a giggle a smirk a nod of the head a pat on the back a fist bump applause etc having a close friend you know well and who know about your anxiety with you in these situation is very helpful on the comment about the connection between toxic shame and self shame imo they are very different thing while i agree that self shame is toxic unhealthy toxic shame is the inherent belief that one is bad unworthy take the author of this post for instance i believe this author to be very wrong for several reason he argues that this deeply held belief usually take root in childhood and is the cause of anxiety i believe he is confusing cause and effect a the old saying go correlation doe not imply causation shame is not the cause of anxiety it is an effect the result of a traumatic past event people do not feel anxiety because they are ashamed they feel anxiety because in their past an event caused them to feel negative emotion what the author refers to a toxic shame is the manifestation of those symptom the person is anxious and ashamed because of their traumatic past take this simple analogy for example john is wife cheated on him john feel embarrassed and ashamed john is afraid to be in another relationship author say john is afraid of commitment because he feel embarrassed and ashamed author say john is afraid of commitment because his wife cheated on him which author is correct author because he dug to the root cause of john is emotional problem the event that led to his shame and anxiety you must realize that people are in many way the same a you they have at some point experienced the same emotion and asked themselves the same question do my friend like me are my peer judging me etc they might seem more calm and at ease but they are no le human emotion are universal use this a a common ground and to remind you that people have their own worry and goal,anxiety

-19.680311,-35.1024,suggestion for working with someone with severe anxiety tl dr i am looking for advice on how i can work better with a co worker who ha really severe anxiety we are co leading a major project together and the project is at risk we need to make change and fast if we hope to save the project but i feel like there is no way to do it without hurting my co leader feeling background i currently work at a really cool company a a project manager and i love my job i love the people i work with i love the work and generally speaking i am very happy in the workplace i am currently working on a very big project that is very important to the future of my company i am currently co leading the project with someone who ha way le formal experience in project management than i do but is otherwise knowledgeable in team management they are a great person and well respected within the company we get along great a people and i would consider them a friend the problem is that the project is way behind and it is getting critical we need to start having some tough conversation and revaluate our process but my co leader struggle with accepting any kind of critique i have to be super careful about the way that i word thing in order to keep them focused on solving a problem and not getting defensive or anxious i feel like i ca not offer them constructive feedback without them taking it very personally i want to help them grow both a a person and a a project manager so i have been taking a lot of time to explain my reasoning and help them understand that it ha nothing to do with them it is all about working together to reach a shared goal even if i am critical of a neutral process not even something my partner created they get super defensive and shut down i have done a good job of creating an environment where my co leader feel comfortable enough to share that they feel super anxious and are not capable of coming up with solution in that mind set but that doe not solve the project is problem my co leader ha been at the company in a much more minor role for more than year this project wa going to be their big chance to prove themselves i have been at the company le than a year but project this size are my forte it is literally why i wa hired what i really want to say to them is well right now you need to get over that so we can fix this but i know that will be counter productive but we have to do something asap the project desperately need more assertive leadership and i do not want to completely takeover because i know that will make my co leader feel bad if i offer solution to fix the project sometimes my co leader get defensive but if i take the time to talk them through it we often end up in the same spot and agree with each other i like them a a person and their mental health is important to me but we literally do not have time or the resource to spend on coaxing my co leader through their personal issue we need to act and we need to do it now in any other scenario i would never let a project get this far without acting but supporting my co leader in both their mental health and their professional development is important to me i think my attempt to meet my co leader need have led the project down a dangerous path and now much is at risk most immediately the project itself but in the long term the future of the company how do i fix the project without hurting my co leader right now i feel like i am stuck having to choose between fixing the project and not hurting my co leader feeling but i feel like there ha to be a middle ground here that i am just not thinking of,anxiety

-60.222675,71.69863,i had my first severe panic attack ever a couple week ago now i m feeling like i m going to hit rock bottom a couple week ago i had an extreme panic attack i had the day off from work and had a great day spent time with lot of friend and wa feeling happy albeit a little more anxious than i usually would on a day off for no particular reason i had a beer with a friend then went to another friend s apartment and smoked a bowl of my own weed there which is absolutely not out of the ordinary and is a pretty tame night for me all of a sudden my vision went really strange kind of fuzzy spinning if i remember correctly i decided to leave because i also felt a little sick i left their place at am i managed to get out of their building then immediately puked on the sidewalk i live across the street from them but have no recollection of going from their sidewalk to my apartment all i remember next is being on the floor of my bathroom puking violently and trying desperately and unsuccessfully to pull myself up from the toilet to the sink so that i could get water all while feeling like i wa having a heart attack feeling like i had no liquid left in all my body i wa screaming for my roommate but he is a very heavy sleeper i guess and didn t hear me an hour and a half later at am i finally managed to reach my phone and call the door to my apartment were locked and once the paramedic showed up the operator instructed me to go open the door but i wa incapable of moving i remember feeling like my entire body wa weighed down by sandbag and i wa just laying on the floor heart palpitating and thinking i wa going to die before they could come in then the police and fire department came to try and unlock my door but the only option wa to break down the door after about ten minute of trying i managed to open my bathroom door but then immediately fell back on the ground i screamed for my roommate once more and he finally heard me and unlocked the door for the paramedic i don t remember walking down the three flight of stair to get to the ambulance but i remember puking again once i got outside and feeling like i couldn t possibly have anything left to throw up and that i am throwing up my actual brain once in the ambulance my heart rate normalized a bit but then i think i experienced some sort of migraine looking at light hurt deeply a well a noise i couldn t lift up my head or open my eye because any stimulus would hurt then i sat in a wheelchair until am when a doctor came to see me and referred me to the mental health clinic and also gave me a note for two day off work ever since then i have been very anxious and depressed yesterday i had my first therapy session and my next one isn t until next month the social worker recommended i go to a walk in clinic there is currently a long wait list for a family doctor where i live and ask for antidepressant anti anxiety med so i can start trying to find something that work for me i am so afraid that this is going to be the rest of my life that therapy won t help that medication will only worsen my symptom or make me so dull and dead inside that it ll be even worse than whatever the fuck this is that i will be unlovable because of this that i will never be able to truly connect with someone that everyone i encounter think that i m a monster that i ll never be able to be a mother that i will waste away into a pit of disgusting worthless nothingness and that i will be alone forever it wa an incredibly scary experience and ever since then i ve been having so many intrusive thought and i m so scared it s only going to get worse a winter progress every time i feel slightly anxious i become more anxious because i m so afraid of it happening again,anxiety

-51.895077,-32.46111,boyfriend m ha anxiety and broke up with me f last weekend please help me understand what is going on hi i posted this in r relationship last week but the more i think about it the more i think it need to be here my boyfriend and i had been together for four month prior to him breaking up with me last weekend we had met online and quickly found that we had a real connection one that we both expressed not ever feeling before we quickly started spending a lot of time together but it wa entirely mutual we both clearly wanted it we have so much in common it is almost like we are the male female version of each other we got very comfortable very quickly i revealed my past bad relationship and he talked about his he had been cheated on more than once by more than one girlfriend and the last one wa apparently especially emotionally abusive to him however it had been year since he had broken up with her so i thought he wa over it they had been together for year he also revealed that he ha anxiety overthinks overanalyzes everything i can relate to this a great deal he also said that he had seen a therapist a while back but had not for a while because we felt such a connection and chemistry we both expressed that we loved each other about month into the relationship it definitely felt completely real and neither of u had any problem expressing it we talked about someday living together getting married etc we made long term travel plan everything seemed great we had a very real connection physically and emotionally one thing to keep in mind is that i have my own form of anxiety that i have struggled with pretty much all my life i worry about thing that are out of my control i worry about the future i get angry frustrated at little thing i can feel depressive moment sometimes early on in our time together i had a major work stress placed on me when my bos went out on maternity leave and i had to be responsible for both her job and my job i did not get a ton of support from anyone on my team this wa a really difficult time for me a i do not know how to deal with stress very well i would vent to my boyfriend about my stress and he would listen and try to help me but did indicate that my anxious mood were rubbing off on him a lot there were time i would break down cry because of the stress and he would try to comfort me but i could tell it upset him i also would cry about seemingly unrelated thing because of my heightened state of anxiety worrying about not being in the same place in life a my friend worried i would fail at work cry about past hurt my ex boyfriend inflicted on me none of this ever had anything to do with the current boyfriend and wa never ever directed at him which i made clear to him but i guess i let myself become too comfortable and vulnerable during this time however i do not think he wa completely upfront about how much this really affected him he had said that his ex before me would get angry and have outburst that were directed at him so my anger anxiety stress triggered some flashback even though it is totally different circumstance and i am a totally different person he acknowledged this but i guess it wa more difficult than he let on his dad also had some anger issue that he took out on my boyfriend that are most likely contributing to this his parent actually got divorced when he wa in early adulthood but they fought pretty much his whole life he realizes how they were never right for each other but that it is best that they are not together but i do not think he acknowledges or even know how much this truly affect him and his outlook on relationship especially when combined with his past bad relationship he know nothing but hurt and pain about a week ago we had some issue over miscommunication regarding our plan to spend time together and for whatever reason i took it personally and got upset again the stress and anxiety the next day we got together and he expressed that he had been feeling uneasy about me because of all of my stress anxiety it had been wearing down on him and he had doubt about wanting to stay with me a i had stressed to him before none of my stress had anything to do with him i apologized for dumping it on him so much and i told him i recognized that i need to make an effort to control my reaction to stress it seemed that he understood and we had talked it through he said it will be okay we will work through this thing seemed to be fine but he also had some increased stress activity in his life that wa keeping him very very busy for the two week after our issue i wa bummed when we could not spend time together but i did understand he wa busy so i let him be he also explained to me that when he feel trapped overly busy and ha no time to himself he can start to really pull away from people he said it is pretty severe then i started to feel him becoming distant and not contacting me a much a he used to the affection he once showed me had all but diminished when we did see each other in person he showed me affection but it wa not the same it finally got to last sunday we had been planning for me to come over after he wa done with thing for the afternoon around pm i had not heard from him in over a day so i wanted to be sure he wa okay and that we were still hanging out his response wa i know i am being distant and weird there is a reason for it i am sorry i am just having issue and i am also not feeling good about everything we need to talk later i do not think this is going to work out with u of course i panicked so i spent the next couple of hour pacing around the house and cry when we finally got together we spent hour talking in my car i asked him what wa wrong he said he is been continuing to have doubt and anxiety and that he is been seeing his therapist for almost a month at that point he said he wa not feeling happy and did not think he feel the same feeling for me that he once did but that he doe still care about me very much i reiterated the fact that i had been working on my own stress anxiety and he did acknowledge that he saw a change in me but he felt that the anxiety he felt before wa not going away keep in mind when we had the issue week ago after we talked he said that he really felt that the feeling of love were there but he wanted to build back up to saying them again which i accepted i asked him why he would say that those feeling were there a few week ago but he is not feeling them now he said that wa wa being optimistic but that he is not feeling great now he expressed concern that i wa too dependent of a person he highly value his own autonomy and independence because i would be bummed out that we could not spend time together i explained to him that i really am not a dependent person but it is because i love him and i probably got carried away with it but it ha always been a mutual thing before he never expressed clear need for space to himself he had helped me with job searching resume writing and expressed concern that i could not do that myself i explained that i only wanted his insight and help because he had been in a similar crappy work situation and i valued his opinion he also expressed concern that i could not handle even little thing in life so how could i handle the big stressor i did not disagree with him on this point but i did reiterate the fact that i am actively working on this for myself and again none of my anger wa ever directed towards him at any point he also worried that we were not compatible with each other even though we had clearly developed a great connection and chemistry that wa evident from the start nothing had changed there he worry that what we had wa just the novelty stage of the relationship he worry i am not the best person for him but also that maybe i am completely right for him and he is just not seeing it he worried we moved too fast even though it felt right for both of u he also worried that maybe he should not even be in a relationship right now because he is so confused and anxious he wanted to take some time and space to himself to figure thing out during this whole talk he seemed confused anxious like he could not believe he wa doing this very conflicted and not himself he even actually said i know this is cliche but it is not you it is me when it got late we called it a night of course i wa sobbing and hurt he ran upstairs to grab the few thing i had at his apartment and brought them down to me he said you may need these thing this week he also gave me my money back for a ticket to a concert that we were planning to go to in june but when he did this he said just in case a he wa getting out of the car he patted squeezed my arm and said we will survive this we will talk later i have not heard from him at all in the week since we left each other but i have not contacted him either i am trying to be understanding and give him the space he seems to need but i am hurting really really deeply i love him so much and i know he is the guy for me it also hurt because i know how much of a connection chemistry we had have and i think he know it too but either is denying it due to fear or his mind is so clouded rattled that he ca not see it he is such a genuinely great guy i ca not see that he would have lied to me in the first place about expressing his love he is actually the one that initiated it is he feeling scared trapped because we moved fast and he doe not want to lose himself in the relationship did i inadvertently trigger a flashback from his past relationship and his parent can he see that i am not like those people and i would never hurt him on purpose doe he have relationship anxiety because we are past the honeymoon stage and he is feeling anxious because he doe love me but maybe think he need to end it before he could hurt a ha happened in the past i should add that he is usually very even keeled but could that be a front for what is going on inside his head i am making plan to go into therapy to sort out my own anxiety but my heart hurt so much for anyone that is in a relationship or ha been in a relationship and this sound familiar please share your thought i am heartbroken because i love him and miss him i am confused and trying to figure this out but i also want to help him should i write an email to him to express my hurt and my concern for him should i let him come to me first is his anxiety a lot more severe than i thought or than he let on is it wrong for me to be hopeful that we could someday work this out once we have had time and space to work on ourselves he left it so open i do not even know if we are truly broken up or on a break he is still friend with me on facebook although he doe not go on there extremely often is that a sign or am i reading too much into it he also accepted a friend request from one of my friend she had sent it prior to finding out we were broken up but a couple day after we broke up he would not have done this if there wa no hope for u and did not want to still be connected to me right if he wanted nothing to do with me would not he have deleted me when i

-55.76471,48.876442,my roommate dropped a bomb on me again so this is a somewhat long story my roommate and i have know each other for a long time we met at work nearly nine year ago actually he wa my bos at a pizza restaurant we quickly became friend and i liked talking to him a lot i wa very attracted to him but i kept my feeling hidden because he wa trying to work thing out with his ex wife at the time eventually they broke up and he started this self destructive path of drinking and sleeping with young girl that worked at the restaurant he asked if i wanted to go to the movie with him once and he wa very polite i wa extremely excited he paid for my ticket and we had a great time together however this is how i found out he had a drinking problem because he cracked open a beer while he drove u to the movie i wa really uncomfortable with this behavior because my dad wa very abusive when he drank but eventually i came to realize this wa not the case with my friend in fact my friend wa extremely functional even though he drank pretty much consistently throughout the day anyway after we went to the movie that night we ended up watching youtube video together for hour in a parking lot i honestly thought we had made a real connection but he never made a move on me we started hanging out pretty consistently after he got his first duo and eventually i met his son he never really introduced anyone to his kid so i felt pretty special he still never made a move on me so i stopped holding out hope for a relationship i met a guy fairly soon after i stopped hoping for a relationship with my friend and i started dating this other guy now it get complicated i wa in a really bad roommate situation but my friend wa still technically my bos at this time everyone thought we were together because we did everything together at this point i wa at his house almost every night because my home situation wa so bad my boyfriend lived over an hour away so it wa too hard to stay with him my friend and i were kind of joking around one day about living together because i wa there all the time anyway and he eventually asked me if i wanted to move in with him so i did we lived together for several month before my boyfriend got really jealous and wanted me to move closer to him over these month my friend and i had gotten really close and his kid and at the time looked at me a a mother figure they asked if i wa going to be their stepmom at one point it broke my heart to leave them when i moved out my friend had several girlfriend during that time period though so i moved out his life started to spiral out of control he got another alcohol related traffic violation and lost his job because they caught him drinking on the job he ended up moving in with his ex wife s mother because he couldn t afford the apartment we had lived in together he stopped dating all together this happened over the course of four year at this point i wa living heh happily with my boyfriend but i sent him a message to the effect of wouldn t our life have been so different if we had ended up together i think i did it because i wa splitting on my boyfriend because why would i have a normal healthy relationship we saw each other pretty regularly still and i got even closer to his kid my friend took my message and ran with it he told me he d always loved me and asked me to marry him he told me his life had started crashing when i moved out and that he d started drinking so much more he said he never thought i d have stayed with my boyfriend that long and wa waiting to tell me these thing i wa so torn you see i didn t know it at the time but my friend wa my fp and i wa so in love with him i thought about it and i told him ok i would leave my boyfriend for him after i said i wanted to be with him we ended up having a huge fight i still don t really know why and he told me not to leave my boyfriend i wa so confused and hurt but i did a he said i thought maybe the alcohol abuse wa what made him become a little volatile towards the thought of being together fast forward a couple of year and he lost another job and got another duo the ex wife s mother kicked him out and he wa essentially homeless the drinking only got worse and i wa watching my best friend waste away he wa down to lb i saw rib through his clothes and he couldn t remember anything he confessed that he wa suicidal but he reached out to me and wanted to get clean i picked him up and brought him home with me i ended up taking him to the hospital because the withdrawal wa too much for his body to handle he did get sober and started going to intensive therapy i wa letting him stay with u and my boyfriend wa so angry about it he kept asking when my friend wa going to leave i couldn t stand the thought of kicking my friend out because i loved him so much eventually we broke up and my friend and i got an apartment together awesome right well we got into another huge fight right after we moved into the apartment again i don t really know what the fight wa actually about i also wasn t expecting that my friend obtaining sobriety would change his personality so much but he wa so withdrawn and would isolate for day on end we didn t talk for several week my heart wa already broken because i lost my partner of seven year and i felt like my relationship with my fp wa lost i kind of thought maybe we might try being in a relationship because of all the thing he had confessed in the past but he said he didn t care about relationship anymore we ve lived together several month now and we re starting to hang out more again and i feel like our friendship is repairing somewhat his boy came over this past weekend now and and we were watching tv with the oldest son randomly my roommate said he wa bipolar because it related to what we were watching my mind wa blown it explains so much but i never knew i don t know what this mean for u a friend he is still my friend but he s no longer my fp i still care about him but i ve hardened my heart a little because i wa so hurt from his personality change after sobriety i still love his kid with all my heart and they love me profusely i don t know if i should let this go or offer support and love i think he s depressed and hurting but he never open up to me anymore i suppose if i m truly honest i still love him but he really ha no interest in me i don t know what to do anymore i ve spent a lot of time trying to better myself and it hurt to watch him not give a shit about anything i recently completed dbt because i know how difficult i can be in relationship i feel like if he told me and his oldest son about his diagnosis that this mean he might want to talk about it right if you ve read the whole thing then you deserve a reward because this is nearly ten year of crap i m unpacking thank you for listening,bpd

-22.84928,-7.169564,how do you know if what you are feeling is depression or just normal sadness for year i have been sure i suffered from some kind of depression either that or some awful type of violent mood swing my one friend in high school referred to it a my shutdown mode where for week i would just stop talking to people whenever possible avoid social situation and see the world in a really negative way in my mind i would go through the same step in my shutdown mode first i would get really upset about something that normally would not bother most people then i would start thinking about how i should not be upset about something like this it is not a big deal then i would think do i really want to live in a world where this insert little dilema is not a big problem then i would start to hate myself for getting so upset so easily i know the above paragraph doe not make much sense and is very poorly written and i would like to apologize to anyone who suffered through reading it that last part is the main component of these stint of what i always referred to a depression i get depressed living a happy life where i am very lucky and have very nice thing then i get pissed at myself for being depressed and that just sort of loop until eventually i get so behind in my responsibility school i am a junior in college now that i have no choice but to suck up my depression for a while anyway on to what led to this post i now have a girlfriend for the first time ever she know that i think i have depression issue but when we were first dating i wa so enraptured with how i felt for her she never saw me sad however i recently went into one of my depression stint where i wa did not want to talk and wa basically non responsive for like a week my girlfriend tried to talk me through what i wa feeling but i admittedly am really difficult when i am in that mode i just keep talking about how much i hate myself and i point out any flaw i have that come to mind and fixate on anything negative in the world around me and talk about how life is not worth living and there is no point in me living because nothing matter i told her about the time i came closest to committing suicide something i have never talked about with anyone after hitting all of these topic i apologized to my girlfriend saying something along the line of sorry i know my head is really messed up what she said ha been on my mind ever since she said listen you are not crazy or depressed you are not special everyone feel like this sometimes you just do not see it those word have been bugging the hell out of me ever since then everyone feel like this sometimes do i just get sad like any other person is this normal in all honesty i can never know because i can never feel the way another person feel i can never get that look right into their mind even worse you are not special i understand what she meant but this part really cut me i now sort of understand how much this self diagnosed and most likely improperly diagnosed depression ha become a part of my identity over the year for some reason it is tearing me apart have i really been whining about everyday problem for all this time am i really fine just a pessimist i sort of forgot why i wa writing for a while but i guess what i want to know is where do you draw the line between depression and just normal sadness i do not expect anyone here to have an answer i just ca not sleep and wanted to vent my thought i feel awful i do not want to see or talk to anyone i do not want to do anything that requires more than minimal brainpower or energy i just want to disappear i clearly do not have enough strength to deal with normal problem in this world and i certainly will never be happy without completely getting in my own way i do not like myself and i do not think i deserve happiness but i am not different that is what she is saying there is no reason for me to be so crippled by my sadness everyone get like this sometimes it is just how life is sorry if you actually took the time to read this i pretty much wrote in one stream with no review so it probably becomes incoherent a i jump from subject to subject and really ha no point to it nor doe it require any specific response although i am open to whatever you have to say,depression

gf is f three week ago i had a conversation with my younger brother whereby he basically called into question my life choice a his older brother and lamented we had no connection since i moved out thirteen year ago i wa already dealing with a cycle and thought i had rode out the worst of it my then girlfriend who ha always been supportive of me during these time and who ha always forgiven me when i made an egregious mistake like having an uncontrollable temper or frequently pushing her away wa sitting just inside the door now admittedly we have our own problem we have been sexless and lacking in intimacy for at least two of the four year we have been together at first we thought it wa an issue stemming back to a rare molar pregnancy she had at the end of our first year together something had changed and that is all we knew she attended therapy for a number of month and thinking that our relationship had the trust love and communication necessary we even opened the relationship she never found a partner to test our theory on my end i have dealt with untreated undiagnosed formally and chronically severe depression along with some anxiety when i met her i did not know how to express my feeling in a healthy way i did not know how to enlist her support when i wa in a cycle and i still do not know how to connect with people in a lasting way i tend to ghost on friend because i present no value to their life eventually even the most dedicated friend fade away and leave everyone leaf in any case after speaking with my brother i felt so alone and proceeded to walk inside and initiate a break up turn out i tested her one to many time and she drew a line a someone who frequently try to empower people so that they do not accept more than they are willing to for no good reason i am immensely proud of her i love her more purely and more fervently than i have anyone else previously i really do believe that she is one of if not the love of my life i know logically that life will go on without her i know intellectually how proud and glad i am that she doe not have to suffer the burden of dating someone who doe not value themselves and i am relieved that should i survive long enough i can try and get some help i am going this thursday in fact to an intensive outpatient program she is even assured me that i am the one that keep drawing clearer line she wanted to call it a hiatus i said i could not live in limbo she wanted to take some time and space i have needed to vent and talk every day to try and help her decide it is now come to the point where she think we should live apart until such time a we might reconcile she say that even if me breaking up with her came from a place that meant oh my god please help do not leave me i feel so alone i raised a number of concern that she had already found extremely troubling namely our virtually sexless relationship we were to a large degree very happy in four year i have eliminated my temper for the most part i have learned mostly how to communicate with her when i am sober minded we were a fantastic team and a super cute couple but a fundamental difference is that i ca not help but feel like love should be enough even if i read that it hurt a relationship i believed that only time and determination wa all we would need to overcome the issue she say she still ha no idea why she love me and ha no desire for any sex with anyone could be a lot of thing honestly chemo a highly anxious and associative brain connecting me to the molar pregnancy event it could be all the time we fought in the first couple year could be could be could be but a problematic relationship no matter how happy is still problematic she ha to want to fix her issue i have to want to fix mine and three year ago when she asked me to get help i refused i have spent twenty seven year fighting depression on my own and have made enormous if also enormously slow success and that success wa exponentially raised with her standing behind me forgiving me when i made a mistake rooting for me to pursue my interest hoping all the while i would value myself and so i am reminding myself that even though the break up is just a trigger i find myself face to face with something i have not felt in a while i do not want to go on it is too much the pain i have endured through my life is just too much and i find it all crashing and breaking on me i am too tired i want to die it is not her fault and i feel guilty for suddenly allowing all my insecurity and neediness to resurface after doing so well for so long now i am co dependent and craving sometimes silently demanding to the universe satisfaction and recompense prior to three week ago we were endlessly supportive of one another now i ca not ask her for help because that would be unfair to her the way i am now she say she can still support me a a friend but i ca not bring myself to do the work to figure out what our place is now in any new context outside of what we might have to do to get back to where we were especially in light of the idea that we could reconcile and i have always been subtly rash rather than outright rash i wa never into self harm because to me it wa short sighted but it doe not change that i have this overwhelming desire not to get better to sink and sink until there is not any choice left until that last tether of pride finally snap unfortunately and speaking of pride i am famously stubborn and i ca not die until i know i left it all out on the field until my last will to survive for something anything is spent and on the one hand i am tired of fetishizing sadness stuck in an eternal loop of that or anger being my only bond to my humanity and humanity a a whole i am tired of intrusive thought and a persistent inner monologue telling me what a piece of shit i am i am tired of only knowing how to connect with loneliness i am resentful of the identity i have built around masturbating to my own depression a long a you make an identity for yourself out of pain you cannot be free from it eckhart tolle i am tired of losing battle i do not think i ever expected to be free but it scare me to come to place where i might want to live and be doing it without someone i care about very much selfishness is one of the only sense of self indicator that people in my position have i have been depressed and devoid of self worth since long before i wa interested in girl or art or could drive i lost hope too early and never found it again until i met her being with her showed me a taste of what it is like to have someone think you are beautiful she called me brilliant one time eloquent at others i wo not say i claim to know her feeling specifically but i could tell she loved me because it wa infectious to me i only recently have started to learn what it mean to value yourself and now i am trying to weather the storm i am trying not to hate myself but that doe not mean i want to live twenty seven year is a long time to be without hope to be riding purely off of an obstinate determination to explore a many option a i could or maybe it is more accurate that i had hoped one day to be free really free and now i see that wa a false hope even on med i will never be free no matter how they loosen the chain i am still a prisoner i am still always filled with fear over every little thing until i am trembling and shaking it never left me even with what i wa learning with her beside me i remember the moment i lost hope it wa the first time i remember seeing my dad with a cigarette symbolic now since i am a smoker i wa sitting on the large concrete step of our townhouse the middle in a row of six which faced a square parking lot with another row on either side to my left and right daddy is got to go away for a little while he said it seems small and is really a moment in a six month tumult just before my parent separated and since then i have experienced technically or objectively far worse ranging from loss to heartbreak to cycle after cycle of loneliness and isolation with my depression and not a single soul to undo the damage that wa being done but i will never forget that moment of feeling like something had changed so radically about the world since then i have been holding my breath underwater feeling anxiety creep into the mix not realizing how disconnected i wa from normalcy using glamorous word to describe thing that are very much perpetuated by habit and continuous self talk when i wa a religious person i held to the idea that the only reason not to die wa that my life wa not my own and for a while that wa enough when i took it my life back suddenly i wa confronted with horrible and abusive habit and expression extreme and unmitigated mental and emotional violence and i wa finally with someone who did not abandon me for never having unlearned those thing but at least in my mind i realize now it had a cost i wa probably hurting her even though i never wasted a chance to get better when she called me on it i never realized how it must have affected her to be with someone who wa always a work in progress so starkly and so continuously and no matter what i do to try and assuage my guilt for having put u over the edge and into this situation i ca not win her back she is a person with her own agency and the only thing i have been able to remember so i do not resent myself is that it is not personal she is doing this for her and i could not be prouder or more heartbroken still even after a day program i might not make it and facing that feeling that i am doing it alone is scary even for a logic minded compartmentalize er like myself even having recently learned that optimism and a notion of hope can be cultivated by transforming my self talk i do not have the strength to watch that seed grow i am just so tired and now i have lost my light the beacon that wa showing me how to love people how to love myself now i am just wandering around in the dark again maybe not immediately but i am not so sure i can outlast the night again i am not doing anything at this moment and what little hope i have cultivated and learned to look to in my mind and thought say that i might feel differently after this program but part of me the strongest and loudest part of me doe not want to running in circle now thanks for reading,depression
-84.71656,-13.208408,restoring clarity first off just wanna warn you this post is long af so bear with me any straight up advice would be appreciated just for a little background i am m and have recently dropped out of university after only month because i realised i made a rushed decision in picking it since then i have almost demonised the thought of going to university even if it were for another course of course this ha left me with a year out which in many way can be refreshing and useful in picking up on experience for work and sociability yet at the moment i am constantly paralysed by thought that even getting out of bed is a challenge i am awaiting check for any condition relating to anxiety and depression i have been going through depersonalisation which is very scary to me the feeling of waking up not knowing the world a it is feeling like a spectator to your physical self i have been able to find a hunger for success in my life but at the moment this is blotted out by the sense that nothing feel real and lacking connection to the outside world my social anxiety ha become very intense recently but i ve always had a desire to be sociable and open to others because i ve always wanted to have plenty of friend i have been able to control it for month at a time but it doesn t help now that it s become worse again distancing behaviour is also present which worry me because i have close friendship which are hard to take interest in when you feel empty a fuck one of my best friend is at a local uni but i see him from time to time a he life a minute away from me even this feel isolating because i m too overwhelmed by my thought feel like i m sinking in wet sand while i m watching everyone walk on really kill me strangely i have lost all interest in activity which is quite offputting when it come into mind but that doesn t stop me from doing them i have started to gym time a week and do badminton every monday night even then i feel like i m sleepwalking through everything and nothing is actually happening playing pool calm me down too i d love to take on a sport competitively to keep me occupied admittedly i spend too much time on technology for year i have spent my free time alternating between education and just gaming and mindlessly scrolling through the internet something which i feel is a stigma for why i feel so empty especially at this point in life i have not had any family issue in life unless sibling rivalry at a young age count i have never experience relationship although i have been involved in situation with girl a few time at the moment i would still be able to show interest in girl but never really feel a sort of connection beyond that a with anyone really i feel like my mental problem have blocked off the idea of pleasure including relationship a i m too overwhelmed with my thought of finding a purpose socially i have been quite disconnected and very weirdly it feel like it s ireelevant to me this i would put down to depression because there have been plenty of time where i ve felt an urge to socialise and i had no problem meeting new people at college i go out clubbing from time to time but i always end up zoning out into my own world of pain i can never connect myself to the present despite this people say i m mature and can speak very fluently despite not feeling like this is the case also simple concept such a friendship feel non existent to me one of the consequence of the forgetfulness i live through best way to describe my anxiety is it almost like i ve been reborn in every way and have no idea how to live and that really scare me a of now the best way to describe myself is i feel alienated and lost the world appears a completely foreign place to me and i fear a lot about the future i ve come to an assumption this is one of the other reason for me feeling depressed i have low self esteem and have been beating myself down about everything recently i find it hard to process information which is tiring but against all odds i did manage to pas my driving test in august first time a lot of day i feel very lonely yet i can t help but isolate a hard a it is to see the way forward amongst the fogginess that is my brain atm i have always maintained a strong interest in creative medium and would like to start seeing sense in life in the present so i can live with clarity and happiness again rather than dreading on autopilot mode i am living at home with my parent and my sister depression make me overlook the appreciation i should feel having a roof above my head yet i still beat myself up because i feel like i should be experiencing life like a uni student should be at this age maybe it s just a matter of loneliness rather than having to party every weekend at it s such a small thing when you think about it yet i feel suicidal when i realise i m spending more time dwelling on the life of others my age than trying to sort mine out pls tell me that s absolute irrational recently i have been lapsing in and out of intense anxiety and this relates to worry of not being able to create a good future and ending up underachieving basically one thought resulting in another thought time this by or i want to seek help but everything ha become so distorted that i sometimes question whether my life is worth living doe this mean decluttering before pursuing my career i feel bad about myself and the fact that i don t have a thicker skin but when you re in such a state it s so difficult to think logically even if starting off i never want to disappoint my parent but hope is so thin when you go each day with a constant internal pain that not even close one can understand i just feel like a living zombie and my thought always tell me i ll never be able to climb out of the hole in short depersonalisation anxiety possibly depression hopelessness lack of motivation is drowning out my desire to go and achieve and i m not sure how to cope a of now i go one day feeling ok and actually find motivation to do small task the next i could feel suicidal and end up sitting in all day isolating myself i really hate this and doesn t define me at all what make me think i m going insane is when someone speaks to me my disassociative state becomes emphasised and once again this creates a new spiral of thought my friend told me i m just overthinking which make sense in some way but i still feel suicidal some day i hope to go travelling around europe and apply for an apprenticeship next year maybe with the bbc i would love to start a youtube channel a this involves technique i learnt at college also i would love to continue on with medium whether it s television production or editing but for now my goal is to rediscover my well being and see life in a positive perspective so i can wake up one day actually knowing who i am physically spiritually and identity wise i m here on this earth in my own body small step but each one to better myself in some way i want to break away from the spiral of living in fear and worry over every small action i make at the moment i am in fear of the world and myself for reason which i can not pinpoint but i want to reach a stage where i can lift myself out of the hole and keep rising sorry for the long as post i d be surprised if you ve made it this far even a i m typing this now my mental state can t even acknowledge what reddit is so bad i know like i m trapped in a hench as bubble around my mind if you have any advice or question please let it out if you need anyone to speak to about interest or whatever your mind can think of don t be afraid to drop me a message stay positive in short i m going through anxiety and depression which ha got me in a state of irrational overthinking and feeling constant fear i still feel a drive to succeed in life but also being dragged into a spiral of depression no matter how hard i try dp dr making me feel super paranoid about everything always have a desire to get back on track but am in a state of total confusion and worry,depression
27.125195,-35.31904,conflicting thought allow me to preface this by saying that this post might not convery exactly what i want it to logically i know i need to get this out my social anxiety is telling me to gtfo and my depression is making me wonder why i have not just offed myself yet so i would not even have to deal with myself anyways yeah so a the holiday have begun to roll around i have found myself slipping back into what would seem to be another major depressive episode yay and it is really throwing me off a these usually do since it is messing with my thought process i can usually organize them into group let is call them train of thought one is purely logic based and i try to adhere to this reasoning a much a i can another is my emotion which i despise but have to put up with the third is usually thinking ahead with a mix of the two it is also where a lot of my anxiety will come from like it ha been for the past week and a half i have been considering making a post here any thought that do not fall into these three category i usually write down because most of the thing i ca not fit into one of these category is usually important somehow and i will forget it otherwise but that s irrelevant moving on the problem is when i get really depressed it is almost a if i ca not sort my thought anymore and the majority become those of the second category my emotion seeing a i hate them so much and avoid working with them a much a possible i am not sure what to do with them so i just have these thought recurring and i ca not get rid of them like that embarassing moment when i wa half asleep in a game of head up up in first grade or wa it really the other guy is fault that i accidentally broke that guitar hero controller in middle school wa my parent is divorce because of me and so on ad nauseum i am really confused at this point i ca not control my own thought anymore i do not feel like i am me anymore i am just a prisoner i suppose in my own mind i am trying to stay clean from self harm a i have been since september but it is very tempting it let me escape my emotion free me for even just a few brief minute it is better than this anything is better than this death would be so much better than this i ca not stop thinking about that i want it to stop i want to stop feeling i want to stop thinking the worst part is i know it will get a little better but then it wo not i know it will let up a bit just for a while but then just a i am getting more used to being able to think again i will be knocked flat by another depressive episode such is the nature of recurrent major depressive disorder i should know i have been dealing with this shit since i wa it wa in july that i got fed up with it and tried to kill myself wa subsequently hospitalized got out did therapy and now everyone think i am better i am not better i have never been better closest i ever get to better is like going from black to a dark shade of grey then back to black again it is tiring irritating and quite frankly i do not see a point anymore i am not quite sure what the point of even writing this post is or wa sorry for venting at you it is not like any of you need me spouting sadness at you i really should just keep to myself more i would also not have to worry about people finding this and linking it to me in real life in the future but here i am posting my feeling everywhere like the idiot i am sorry i will shut up now,depression

-26.022562,-39.55882,long background history dump let me preface this by saying i do not expect anyone to read all this i simply ca not sleep so i am typing on my phone sorry if formatting is horrible i will try also if anyone doe actually read any of it i do not have anything to specifically ask and i am not really looking for any advice in particular unless anyone want to mention any personal experience with different type of therapy counseling a i only have experience with cbt and personally feel that it help me very little mainly i just ca not sleep and well ranting ca not hurt nbsp background throw away account i am a year old male who is currently living at home attending university trying to graduate and get a degree in applied mathematics in a happy and healthy relationship have a supportive girlfriend and family most of my issue are self caused nbsp i honestly do not know when my depression started but the event that triggered it occured between th and th grade i used to be very religious methodist and wa active in youth group and such there wa an assignment once to think of three people that we thought needed christ in their life immediately someone popped into my head i would heard him talking on the bus and just had a feeling i thought of him because religion came up once on the bus and he basically said the bible wa bullshit and god wa not real and on the off chance he wa he never helped me any so fuck him so even though he popped into my mind i did not bother with it about a month later he killed himself it wa basically th grade when i wa really processing it and at first i blamed god wondering why he would do such a thing i pondered it over and over until i came to believe that there wa no god and regardless of if he wa real or not i did not need some abstract concept like god to try to help people i would depend on myself i felt guilt for many year over his death i knew it wa not my fault and that i probably could not have helped but the thought that i did nothing wa what brought on my guilt and sometimes still doe i did not know he wa depressed not to mention suicidal but i had the feeling back from the youth group assignment that he needed something nbsp the above pushed me into a more scientific and realistic world view i became atheist and wa depressed but had a positive outlook still thought if there is no god and no afterlife then this is all we have so every moment is precious and best make the most of it i also refused to ever use something like religion a a way for help i am not saying that religion ca not help some people but i knew that broaching a topic like religion could be intimidating or off putting but there wa no excuse for not being able to simply talk to someone and just ask about them and even though i sometimes still feel guilt for the above it is nothing major anymore and ha led me to helping three people that i know about who were about to commit suicide to not do that and all of them are now in better place we have never discussed it and there is no need to it is nice just knowing that they are better off and have some semblance of happiness so i view the above event a bittersweet nbsp throughout highschool i kept pondering on my life view i slowly developed a more negative view that of a nihilist that in the grand scheme of thing from the universe is point of view we are small meaningless existence floating like speck of dust and gone in the blink of an eye i believe this philosophical viewpoint is where most of my issue arise from currently i am able to discern that the universe is point of view is not mine and is of a completely different reference frame but whatever my own personal view should be always feel moot since it is smaller and contained within the above it doe not help that depression ha taken away all my like interest passion and hobby and left me only with a desire to sleep so that i do not have to think or deal with reality nbsp that cover highschool and most of my original year of college what i mean by that is that in junior year of college i dropped out i originally wanted to do engineering and went to a prodigious school for it but my grade were piss and i realized engineering wa not what i wanted i felt lost and got more depressed i got so bad that a i stated i dropped out i went home and took some time off i transferred to a university near home and went for applied mathematics math wa the only concept from all my engineering course i enjoyed or at least thought wa bearable it seemed like a good fit because i enjoy puzzle and get bored very easily so i could jump from topic to topic in mathematics and solve problem in different manner for awhile it went ok wa getting medicine and trying to find what worked originally it wa wellbutrin and celexa though i required basically max dose for both and the mg of wellbutrin pushed me over the edge to give me horrible anxiety which i have no experience with nbsp the cbt therapist i see is actually a forensic psychoanalyst who just us the cbt approach he diagnosed me with dysthymia and wanted to switch my medicine the med were first prescribed at my first university from a university psychiatrist he preferred effexor to wellbutrin and buspar to take care of anxiety so i tried them out for about three week and effexor wa similiar effectiveness a wellbutrin besides higher libido and making me either sleep way better or worse idk which just that it wa nearly impossible to wake up the buspar did great for anxiety but made me feel light headed a lot had an appointment to follow up after the first three week of med but i missed it little before this change of medicine i could feel another major depressive episode starting they usually do when i am in school i also have hypothyroidism and had run out of that medicine like a week before this change now i have been off the thyroid med for around month and the antidepressant and anxiety med for a month major depressive episode is also in full swing a well i realize that i would be better if i had med but the effexor wa horrible with the sleep the buspar wa horrible with light headedness have to drive to university honestly felt like i would pas out sometimes and it just felt dangerous only really have energy to get to and sit in class and also due to med side effect i have had no real desire to make an appointment to see him to hear how i have been off these med could go back to wellbutrin and celexa but that wa not very effective though at least not really bad side effect besides the crippling anxiety nbsp the worst part i guess is that it all so frustrating at my previous university i did not care at all and had horrible grade simply because i did not show up but performance wise like test grade i would ace now i care and i am trying but my grade are bad because i feel like i am in a fog cloud and i ca not concentrate and even when i can it is like i am not learning because nothing stay in my head and i ca not remember anything i feel like it is going to be a wasted semester and that i will have to retake all these class due to failing it feel like i am trying but i am just hitting a wall and the more effort i put in just mean i hit it harder and get more frustrated anxious and disheartened i am lucky i have such a good girlfriend and family that support me and i should rely on them more but i do not really know what to ask for help with and honestly i just feel ashamed most of the time everyone say i am smart and yet i still ca not seem to get my degree where everyone else i knew finished year ago i want to be able to move out and live with my girlfriend and marry her well get engaged but i need to be able to support her which i ca not currently and i feel like i will never be able to pas and graduate and that i am holding her back that scare me the most that i will lose her because i am unable to just get this stupid piece of paper so someone will hire me i do far better with a regular everyday schedule and job and school is a large factor for my depression and cause me endless frustration and feeling of entrainment anyway i am finally

world since i had been entirely isolated since first grade a in i had no interaction with anyone but my mom and did not even go to school my life is good now for the most part my family is great i have got my own gadget phone laptop headphone other stuff learned to play guitar and i have got a ton of nice cali levi american eagle etc clothing courtesy of social service overall i would say i should be happy by most standard and i am not inherently unhappy my depression is practically nothing compared to what it wa a few week ago i started taking antidepressant but they caused me to have anxiety attack so my doctor told me to stop taking them until i see him which is tomorrow overall i am doing well other than being lonely i do not have many friend because when you have no social interaction for of year of your life almost counting bouncing from group home to group home your social skill are not that great lou the depressed girl i will talk about soon and who is the main subject of this post not her real name is the only person i would consider a friend i have had girlfriend and had sex and all and there have been people i have talked to in school once i entered this highschool but none i talk to anymore or ever got close to so other than intense loneliness i am good lou she is a lot worse off she is not in foster care her parent are abusive still she used to be addicted to drug she is on a cocktail of antidepressant now she is mildly suicidal and ha been for a long time she wa seriously suicidal before i knew her she is been raped one of her ex sexually abuse her to this day under threat of violence should she contact the police or try to disappear for good from him she and i have talked extensively about this and we have an action plan once she get into college but until then she wo not do anything i would literally kill the guy myself if i knew where he lived he is not worthy of the title of human and deserves a fate worse than death and she is just a lonely a i am if not more and she is attending counseling so that is just the surface of both of u and only what she is told me because i know there are thing she ha not opened up to anyone about yet since i am the one who is better off and more emotionally stable i have tried my best to be supportive for her i always text her goodnight and good morning frequently remind her i am always here if she need to talk about anything that i love her that it is all going to be okay thing like that she is said recently she feel hopeless so i have taken to attaching reminder of thing she is one day closer to every night when i wish her goodnight thing like when she will save her first life a a nurse or doctor get married be happy that sort of thing for valentine is day i am going to write two long love note and one recording on a micro sd card one love note will be for this year the other will be next year is and have the sd card attached buried in a jar under folded piece of paper reminding her of thing she is one day closer to which i will tell her to open one per day i will make a second jar of paper with various feel good thing on them and tell her to open some whenever she feel particularly down like how beautiful her green eye are joke thing like that so am i doing the right thing in this situation i know that nothing i can possibly do will cure her depression is not like that i know since i experienced severe depression myself my aim is to try and help her keep her head up a little higher and focus on what is coming rather than the horror that wa and is her life and overall just to make sure she know someone love her unconditionally no matter how bad thing get or how lowly she think of herself and to basically just be supportive aside from all that she is recently become really antisocial nearly cutting all contact with me and her other best friend she is known for a few year she will send me about text per day top in response to whatever i send her which is in stark contrast to the constant talking we have done since we first met a far a i know this is not good but also is not entirely abnormal i am a little worried about it though could any of this make her feel worse somehow i have thought it over myself and i am doubtful but extra perspective would be helpful thanks,depression

-74.61378,-15.488687,sadder than ever i am currently a sophomore at a big university and i have never felt so lonely and sad and depressed in my entire life it all started when i moved to a different state before the start of middle school i never fit in at my new school at my old school i wa full of life and i wa a star student i got straight a is i would win election for student council i had a fierce love for the performing art piano band theatre etc i wa so happy unfortunately that wa all taken away from me when i finished th grade my parent were the kind of people that liked to withhold information i found out i wa moving that very summer and i never got to say goodbye to any of my friend at my new school state i wa so focused on my old school and some crazy notion that i could actually go back that i really wa not living in the moment there wa a bit of a culture clash i wa from a small rural town and i moved to a wealthy suburb i had an incredibly hard time making friend and keeping them i wa an insecure young girl and i wa desperate to fit in anywhere i tried to fit in with this group but i wa often ditched at the lunch table i would sit there awkwardly eating alone and it made me sad and worse embarrassed i often felt like that friend of convenience people would chat with me until someone more popular or desirably came along then they would act like they did not know me i will never forget the time i went away on a school trip to canada in middle school and i would have no one to eat with when we stopped at restaurant i learned that the five girl i roomed with never actually liked me and talked behind my back when we stopped to go tobogganing at this place we had to form group the roommate rejected me when i assumed i would go with them it wa so disheartening i remember cry by myself in an isolated area i have not even told my parent about this a you know middle school wa a painful time i thought high school would be better but i wa wrong on the first day of high school i remember being blatantly ignored by every person i knew i wa sad and angry i ate lunch a bathroom stall during that first week it wa not until someone i knew helped me out and found a group for me to sit with the girl were all a year older than me but i connected with them it wa the first time that i felt like i belonged wa i happier i think so but my insecurity from middle school carried over i always thought that people favored other people over me it wa a very toxic thought i always felt a if the prettier person wa more well liked even in high school and here is the gist i never felt pretty then i would remember how all the girl around me would get attention from boy and that i wa unwanted i know it is a stupid thing to harp on but i wa never asked to prom i know that in retrospect it wa a silly thing to get upset over but at the time this did nothing for my faltering self esteem the problem wa that at my school the promposal wa this outlandish display that every person looked forward to it wa hard to see some guy play an instrument for a girl in front of my entire class or someone to spell it out with giant letter for the whole world to see it only asserted my loneliness i must say that i had become extremely withdrawn in high school i became so used to being ignored that i suspected that no one i interacted with truly valued me a a friend and that i wa this temporary sidepiece i did not go out my way to talk to people i let them come to me and that wa rare i did not hang out with friend very often and i basically came home and sat in my room all day looking at my computer i wa empty i wa sad it wa at it worst in high school after my friend left the most disappointing part about all of this wa that i lost that light i used to have a an elementary schooler i lost my spark my grade suffered immensely i went from being a top student to someone who still took challenging class but rarely cared at all i could not concentrate i wa frustrated i developed awful eating habit eating ton of junk food i wa always exhausted i passed out every day after coming home from school i participated in performing art extracurricular activity but even that wa only temporary happiness i lost my love for music and piano i quit during my junior year because i wa sick of getting yelled at by my piano teacher i stopped practicing while before i used to play for hour on end there wa so much pressure on me to do well in school and get good score on the sat that i suffered numerous emotional breakdown i told my doctor about my health concern on two occasion and she recommended seeking psychological help my parent refused i guess my life is filled with many regret because my grade fell and i could barely concentrate i did not live up to my fullest academic potential i wa rejected from my dream school in the ivy league so i settled for my current big with the intent of transferring out the first year college wa supposed to be better now that i would not be around the same people oh boy i wa wrong my insecurity carried over and i suffered from extreme shyness the biggest problem is that i go to a party school and i am not a drinker people tell you that you do not have to drink to fit in but let me warn you right now based on what college you attend it is pure bullshit at my school in the middle of nowhere all activity are surrounded by drinking it is inescapable it is the only way to meet people and be social freshman year it did not help that i had a hard time connecting with people in general i wa hesitant to talk to people or be out going because i suspected that they never wanted anything to do with it wa not until the end of the year that i realized that my toxic way of thinking burned so many bridge and contributed to my own unhappiness i had these great roommate who could have been great friend but my chaotic state of mind prevented that i cut conversation short because i never thought people were listening i always thought i wa unworthy strange enough at the end of freshman year i wa at these audition i usually kept to myself at these place but something changed that particular day i wa in a group with two other people and i something within me just exploded i began initiating starting conversation and people listened and they had a great time it wa a strange feeling i felt this sort of high from it all it reminded me of the good ole day back in elementary school when i wa genuinely happy in that moment i felt a if i realized what my problem wa and what i could do to fix it i wanted to feel that high on life again and again so after that day i have been more out going more initiative more optimistic about people that semester my grade turned around close to a i read a lot of self help book to help me cope i wa excited to return to school in the fall with my new no judgment philosophy sophomore year started out great i wa extremely busy with project outside of school and i took class that truly interested me i got straight a is i had a great roommate i became a more open person i made an effort to make friend and be a friend i even went out a couple weekend and interacted with people i did not drink very much at all but i still had a great time then this semester my roommate moved out i live alone now at first i thought it would be awesome to have a room to myself and i wa not worried about delving back into depression again because i had already experienced the worst thing started out okay i wa le busy outside of school so i wa in the room more often i wa doing okay for a while but then loneliness kicked in i do not know anybody on my floor because i wa always gone the first semester because we are no longer freshman nobody really make an effort to bond i enjoy my class right now and i talk to people i know however outside of that i return to my room alone i usually eat alone i go place alone i never actually developed a close friendship with anybody nor have i ever been a part of a friend group in the fall i had developed this dgaf be yourself philosophy that i lived by for a couple of month i became more assertive and i tried to find my old self again but now loneliness seemed to cancel all of that out i have taken up exercising which ha helped a lot it wa hard to not have anybody in middle school and high school but now i feel even sadder in college i am very close to my family and i call my mom almost every day i walk this campus every day alone and i feel so out of place i see people with their group and i am always alone i just wanted to be a part of something to fit in i guess it is this innate human desire one night i got extremely sick i thought i had appendicitis my phone had stopped working and i could not call any friend out of the blue to drive me to the hospital since i did not know anyone on my floor i skyped with my mom it get better she wa visiting family and a big group of people came on the webcam to wish me better this wa the only moment of my life that i cried because i wa so happy i always felt so insignificant and to see that assertion of love wa priceless i wa lucky that my brother wa in town that night and drove me to the hospital instead in a way my sadness is worse than before because i do not have a light to hold on to a piece of me wonder if i should have transferred and started over fresh somewhere closer to home i am wondering if i am just not happy here or not happy in general i miss the unconditional love of my family i have made a conscious decision to go in for therapy this week and talk this out there are many aspect of my situation that i have not talked about for reason of privacy i came across this area on reddit while looking for article about college student

non diagnosed but very real ocd that eventually went away for the most part but not completely my parent are great and i love them but i can just remember cry and screaming often and feel very irritable a lot of the time through my childhood my parent thought i just had a temper and they even would threaten to take me to counselling many time but i always absolutely refused that and they never forced me flash forward to being around i started self harming after a silly middle school boyfriend broke up with me i did not think the sadness would last so long but soon enough i wa just sad and hurting myself for other reason and many time no reason at all i wa engaging in various form of self harming had suicidal thought involved myself in risky behaviour etc my parent knew about all this but for some reason they never really did too much about it we get along but we are not close at all and i barely tell them anything about my life so maybe they just felt uncomfortable and didn t know what to do i also claimed to be fine every time they asked me how i am a they would come in my room about time a night while i wa in high school to ask me how i m doing and if everything s okay looking back they were definitely concerned about me but they just didn t really say much they even found a bunch of self harming thing in my room once and confronted me and then said if you ever feel like this again go talk to someone and my mom cried a lot but that s all that happened flash forward to now i am year old i m only in my first year of university because i am so indecisive and can barely make a small decision for myself and didn t do anything for year after high school but worked and hated my life and here i am now year old and at university for something that i m not all that interested in but i get decent grade now i know this sound silly but the thing is i m not interested in anything i don t have hobby i wake up every day and i think about why i m still here i just honestly don t see a purpose of my existence and i do not enjoy my life for the most part i can t stop thinking what my purpose here what s the fucking point of this i think about how embarrassing my whole life is and i knew it wa going to end up this way i just knew it i wa always that person in my friend group and they are all so successful i hate my life and i don t see that changing anytime in the future i m not looking for pity or anything like that i just don t have anyone i feel comfortable communicating this to in my real life the funny thing is my friend have no idea i feel this way i dream about suicide i think about suicide every single day wishing i wasn t so scared to do it my first thought every morning is great another day that i do not want to live through i cry every single day i stopped cutting myself for a while but now i am doing it again i smoke weed regularly because it make the world seem not so scary and take away my sadness a little even though i know it s really not helping my situation i see the world differently than i used to and it s very very depressing unwelcoming scary and seems totally pointless i often ponder thing like what is the purpose of life why are we all here and i get scared i keep googling thing i think or feel that i don t think are related to this but search result always come up with depression i have almost all the classic symptom of depression sadness hopelessness uninterested can t concentrate can t make even the simplest decision headache tired all the time on top of all the other stuff i previously mentioned i also once went googling all these thing i feel and know about my personality and i started reading about borderline personality disorder i seem to fit in this category pretty well although i am not a doctor obviously i had a very click moment when i started researching it on top of all of this i feel anxious almost all the time especially in public im so paranoid people are looking at me talking badly about me and it cause me to stay at home sometimes or when i do go out i am so nervous the whole time and it drive me insane but then every once in a while i have day where i think wow why wa i so sad i do not need help that s embarrassing i thought that but then it go right back to where i wa i think it s just moment of happiness coming to me sometimes but then i go back to seeing how everything truly is basically i want to know and i know this sound silly but it s very scary for me doe it sound like i should finally seek professional help i m tired of feeling like this but i m scared it will go away soon and then i ll just feel stupid for overreacting it like when i m in a burst of happiness i believe that everything i think when i feel depressed is a lie and i m just overreacting about this whole thing but then i go right back to feeling depressed and it doe not feel like a lie i also feel like medication is not going to help and i do not necessarily like taking medication but clearly this ha been going on and off over the course of my whole life i m also terrified about talking about this to someone in person i feel like i won t be able to get the word out tldr i do not

-74.14343,-8.10217,very long i wa finally doing well and then i lost it is gonna be real lengthy but i really really want to put this out if even one person read this i will be okay with that and highly appreciative excuse my poor writing skill it wa never a strong point of mine throwaway i am the depression is been around since i wa the start of high school social isolation and abandonment i thought it wa just my personality just how i wa i did not learn that the intrusive thought were a result of depression until a year into college the first thing i lost wa my friend after freshman year of college i did not make the effort to maintain any connection i declined any invitation i turned people away everyone i met during freshman year and my few friend i managed to keep from high school gone there wa one person who did not turn away and who kept pushing to stay in contact with me it wa a woman and naturally i fell in love with her like with my depression i did not know that i wa in love at first i just knew that i enjoyed every second with her i wanted to get closer to her i appreciated every little thing she said and did every aspect of her and i had never felt that way about anybody it took me a year of seeing her several time a week to put the piece together and by that time i had realized that she did not feel the same way she said she wa not looking for a relationship and she did not have any romantic feeling for me so i kept my mouth shut i figured i would rather be friend than take the risk of telling her how i feel and potentially ending up with nothing i am no gambler so i did everything in my power to fall out of love with her so that it would be le painful for me to be around her because the stronger my feeling for her got the more pain i felt knowing that i could not be with her i started hanging out with her le i did not respond to her text a often i started talking to other girl and even dated another girl who i ended up feeling nothing for and hurting her it wa hopeless no matter what i still thought about her every day and saw every other girl a incomparable eventually she must have given up because we did not talk for month at one point this wa good for me overall i finally started to forget about my feeling during this time though i continued to lose interest and motivation at school the therapist i enjoyed seeing moved away i had zero social interaction besides superficial meaningless small talk i questioned my future and my capability i started to lose hope every night for month i would walk out of my dorm past midnight say i wa going for a walk if anyone asked find somewhere really high enjoy the view for a minute look down and cry my grade plummetted i only attended class i considered fun and only on occasion i wa about to finish my first junior semester with all f is after previously achieving all a is my freshman year and so out of my own volition i withdrew from school on psychological leave wasting my parent money and soon my own thanks to debt i continued to live near the university these were the second and third thing i lost my motivation for school and my wealth shortly after dropping out i decided to commit of my time to video game sound crazy and lazy right sure it wa but it wa something i could put my entire self into i did not have to care about anything outside of the game i wo not put many detail but i ended up finally getting signed by a pro team i wa making about the equivalent of minimum wage but hey i did not care i wa playing video game thing were going well i barely ate anything and i left my room maybe once a week but i wa able to make payment towards my rent and my student loan with the money i wa making there wa one big problem though my health caught up with me playing in a highly competitive and stressful enviornment for hour a day with my sleeping pattern and eating habit caused me to burn out i started to hate the game i started to hate practicing i stopped improving a a result i got benched from my team not kicked benched since i wa still legally bound to the team this meant i could not just find another team until my contract expired or i wa bought out yeah i did not sign the best contract in the world after having an attorney look at it he said there wa no legal action to take and all i could do ask the team owner to terminate it the team owner did not terminate it he thought i wa going to be bought out i did not get bought out i stopped playing the game and waited for my contract to expire by the time it did it wa too late i wa trash at the game and nobody knew me anymore just two more thing that i lost i lost my team and i lost the only passion i had i went into a kind of a really bad state i turned off my pc i turned off my phone i locked my door i did not do anything i laid in bed for a month let the trash pile up in my room let myself starve contemplated the most efficient and painless method of suicide i could it wa too painful to even live although i did nothing i remembered something around the time i wa finally preparing to kill myself it wa her birthday soon i turned my phone on and found a couple text of worry waiting for me from online acquaintance but they meant nothing to me i left her a brief birthday message on facebook and went to lay down again soon after i got a text just looking at the name made my chest tighten up she sounded so happy to hear from me even though it wa just a small happy birthday message even though i ignored her for month even though i had been trying to forget about her and yet she wa ecstatic and wanted to meet up with me i could not do anything but cry into my pillow and stare at my phone what had i been doing i felt all sort of regret i regretted not reaching out to her i regretted ignoring her i regretted making a suicide plan without considering her and her feeling i regretted neglecting my health everything i wa about to be kicked out of my apartment my lease wa almost up and you had to be an enrolled student at the university to live there so before i had to move back to my parent place i met up with her it wa going pretty well we caught up on the lost time and i noticed i wa not a crazy in love with her anymore since it had been so long which wa what i wanted there wa one part of the conversation i have not forgotten though she mentioned that she wa in a relationship with someone that really threw my head for a spin i felt a whole bunch of thing i recalled that she said she did not want a relationship with anyone and now she had one okay maybe something changed i felt happy for her i also felt confused i also felt a little jealous i know it had been a long time it wa bound to happen given how she is so i accepted it pretty easily but overall i still felt pained i promised her that i would not ignore her again and i moved away and entered the next phase of my life i like to call this part of my life the neet phase do not worry i am almost done this phase started august i became an mmorpg addicted unemployed out of school room dwelling leech i cut every source of stress out of my life i no longer had to pay rent there were no people around so i did not feel a isolated i no longer competed i did not have to do any work i had no obligation i just played this mmorpg for fun all the time and i would text her every here and there it wa kind of pitiful in the sense that my best defense against depression wa getting rid of everything but it worked i started working out i started eating healthier and gaining my weight back i got my hair cut and learned to style it i learned what facial hair worked for me i kept my room clean i bought clothes that fit me i worked to eliminate my bad habit i took care of my eye i made friend in the game i wa playing it felt really good to improve myself and my health i knew i could not live a a neet forever i felt ready to re enter society but before i did that there wa something i wanted to do first i wanted to see her again she wa about to move away from the university we went to to go to grad school relatively far away it would not be a easy to visit her later so i did it sooner i made plan to come up and visit her and stay at her apartment for a week she sounded really excited and happy about it so i got excited too here we go i prepared for a bit to get my stuff together for this trip it had been almost a year since we last saw eachother but we had been keeping contact this time i do not really know what i expected but i wa at least excited i get there and we immediately go into our own little world of conversation just like always she would listen to my story and i would listen to hers we would bounce question off eachother she would laugh at my awful joke it wa refreshing she told me that the relationship she had the year before never really went anywhere and that she wa once again not really interested in relationship i felt a little selfishly relieved we made some food and ate together it wa simple nothing fancy but it wa probably the best meal i have ever had in my life i could not remember when the last time i had a meal with someone wa i could not sleep that night not because it wa an unfamiliar roof or because i wa uncomfortable but because i kept recalling our interaction and the thought made my heart beat fast and i just could not stop smiling by the time the sun came up i realized something really important it did not matter one bit that i only got to see her once in the last two year it did not matter how hard i focused on myself and it did not matter how hard i tried to forget about her before i wa still in love with her i decided i wa done trying to throw those feeling away and i accepted it i wa more in love with her than ever before for this day and a half i think i think i have never felt happier in my life i got a taste of what it is like to feel like a human being i wa not the kid in the corner at lunch in highschool i wa not a drained college student on autopilot i wa not a starving teammate that everyone thought wa riding a contract high i wa not a suicidal lifeless zombie i wa not a mmorpg addicted neet i wa a human being i spent a lot of the day thinking about whether i could do anything with my rekindled feeling i wa feeling hopeful i wa choosing my word carefully and i really wanted to take the risk because i thought it wa possible at the same time it wa clear that she wa thinking of something too it seemed like something negative because a lot of her mannerism suddenly changed i would spent enough time with her to be able to tell at least that much i asked but she said nothing and so i did not pry being nosy wa a habit that i had worked to get rid of it lowered my mood a bit knowing that she wa mulling over something and there wa nothing i could do she did say something though she said she thought i should go home it really caught me off guard because just the day before she seemed perfectly content with having me over for the rest of the week she gave an excuse along the line of having to work and that we would not have much time to do anything anyway i disagreed and said even if it is only a fraction of the day i would rather stay after all there wa still another day i had suddenly after a relatively quiet dinner where she wa texting someone for most of it she speaks up she start off by telling me that she had lied about not being interested in relationship because she wa in one seriously again then she say that the real reason she asked me to go home wa because they were coming over to see her before she moved a well i am amazed at how calm i wa able to act i thanked her for being honest and said it is totally fine while somehow smiling the whole time inside my head though i could feel it it wa like a time bomb had just started and i knew when the timer ran out i would break down i hung around for a bit trying to reassure her that i thought it wa fine maybe she could see through me too because she seemed genuinely worried and kept apologizing over and over when i got the chance though i walked out immediately i found a set of stair and let my head hang in my hand i sat like a statue and lost track of time my head wa filled with self loathing thought i would never hated myself more i let myself fall in love again i let myself get my expectation up high i let myself trust her word wholeheartedly i let myself feel hopeful and i wa wrong wrong wrong wrong about everything even though i had learned before how she wa and how she felt about me i still clung to the tiniest bit of hope just to have it cut instantly i go from feeling happier than ever before to worse than ever before over the course of a day you know how when you jump in to a cold pool when it is hot out the pool feel way colder than it is because of the change in temperature that is a bit how i wa feeling i went from feeling ecstatic and more in love than ever to feeling like complete garbage i could not even cry i had already used up all my tear i considered all of the positive thing i had done over the past year and i considered it all wasted i knew i would not feel a happiness like that ever again it is impossible i ca not truly love other woman because she is the only one i will ever have feeling for and i wo not ever be able to get her out of my head especially not now every relationship i will ever have will fail because i met her and i ca not be in a relationship with her either she ha never and will never feel the same a me and yet i still go through the same pattern i get my hope up i think that there is a chance i find out that i am wrong and i get hurt every word that she speaks feel like a dagger through my chest because the more i love her the more pain i feel i am done i am sick of it i give up i do not want to talk to her until i feel absolutely nothing for her it could take two year it could take a lifetime i thought these thing over the course of my minute breather i went back inside and she started to try and cheer me up she started talking to me more than the whole day offered to do thing with me or order some junk food i wa disgusted i told her i did not want any pity i told her i did not want her to lie to me in order to not hurt me at this point it wa all just filler though my mind wa made up i wa just letting my mouth run and say whatever it want i have never acted like such a shithead to her before i told her i did not want to be there any more it wa nearly midnight and i started packing my thing to drive home i gave her some half assed conversation a half assed hug a half assed goodbye and fucked off i am really not sure if she understands why i wa acting the way i wa i do not even know for sure if she know how i feel about her or how much pain i have gone through it is so obvious how i feel about her that her friend who had never met me were able to figure it out i considered telling her before i left just to throw that burden on her i decided against it even though i did not want to see her again i do not want to cause any more problem for her this wa hour ago since then i have regressed i am back to my worst i ca not move out of bed food make me feel sick i want to stop existing and so i have disabled any form of contact with anyone if for some reason i run into anyone face to face i will just act completely fine and get them to think nothing of me i do not want to kill myself anymore i want to be nothing if life is supposed to be so hellish then maybe i am supposed to be here existing is my punishment for being unable to control the mind i have been given i plan on living the emptiest life i can i will find a job i will finish school i will work until i ca not and then i will give all my money away before i die there is nothing good waiting for me and even if there is i will not look for it because i will just ruin it and so that is how i lost her and myself i always hated losing but i am a loser and there is no denying it i lost my social life i lost my motivation i lost my wealth i lost my team i lost my passion i lost her and i lost myself depression win

-28.42458,-36.881634,the lack of control make u feel inhuman though no one control anything hi depression this is long so here is the tl dr my life story and how i have come to understand depression and myself over the year now thing are changing and i am depressed again because i have learned fear suffering and therefore anger for my own father my story of depression grows every day along an indescribable number of good story and pleasant memory i wa bullied between second and ninth grade eight sixteen year of age in tenth grade i left new jersey because my father wa transferred to vancouver this wa an interesting time my depression subsided and i became an active member of a summer soccer school when school started i did everything i could to be friend in hindsight i could have chosen better friend next year i fell in love for the first time however after eleventh grade i moved to florida her and i tried the long distance thing but it did not work a few month later my current girlfriend and i started dating and we are a great couple i tell her everything and she understands my point of view there is no need for more back story i wa bullied because i wa different my time wa spent reading writing and practicing other aspect of academia people treated me like an outsider in those eight year in nj i did not make one friend it wa the loneliest time of my life in ninth grade i found refuge with other outcast though most of them were pushed away by others and not themselves i started hurting myself and in ninth grade i attempted suicide by taking pill of advil next year i made my first real friend let is call her po she wa an outcast too and halloween hallowed the birth of some awful rumour about po i wanted to be popular wanted to be recognized so i ignored her and tried to socialize with a coterie that felt wrong i continued hurting myself and felt desperate no one knew how far down the rabbit hole of insanity i ventured i taught myself to tie a noose and hung it around my neck and spent some time figuring out where to fall from the choice wa abandoned with the thought of burdening my parent and my younger brother next summer po and i started dating and we were madly in love my depression subsided and i got back on my foot and began to understood who i am i realized that no one know what they are doing and that selflessness is key to releasing oneself from this world my philosophy and worldview became recognizable it wa not until later i had stumbled onto buddhism without knowing buddha po and i fought and were a normal couple lot is of great memory too when i moved to florida i started feeling lonely again i recognized that depression is the absence of controlled emotion therefore the sphere of feeling i have are smaller than those without depression yes i can feel happiness but it is not full of grandeur because it is ignorant happiness because of my depression is manifestation i made a mistake and let another girl become close to me she kissed me and i told po the next day po and i broke up later that week this new girl and i dated for two month and i realized i could not stand her but i could not conjure up the courage to break up with her she eventually went on a trip and i stopped texting her she broke up with me i assume out of fear of not being broken up with after two week my best friend let is call her layla and i started dating layla is everything i could ever want and hope she is understanding and welcoming of who i am and all that i have been through my story is darker than i am telling however her and i fell in love a naive and precious ecstasy that word ca not describe i felt happy again and my depression subsided after dating po my thought were always much clearer i wa accepted into my dream school this school is the reason why i did not want to die after sophomore year the worst part is like every private school in the u it is pricey i do not mind the debt it is for my dream and i have released myself of worldly physical possession i have also released myself of fear and suffering there wa a point that i believed suicide wa the answer because it would give me control over something i stopped feeling this need to control and learned about the beauty in the world and in all people i forgot hate and anger after this epiphany my belief is simple that the world is simple and that it can be explained simply the reason for this post is i have started hating again and am now afraid my father is physically abusive and everything i do not want to be his catharsis come from money his world is dominated by physicality he forgot happiness to find money he tell me that the reason he doe not leave his work is because he is providing for our family i tell him we do not need to have two car or go on vacation then i get hit my own stubbornness belief that he recognizes i am correct he realizes that he is afraid and petty i hate my father because he force control on me i ca not see layla i ca not read i ca not study all i can do is look for money for when i go to college honestly i looked for work and nowhere is hiring even still i look for a job this summer i have been studying a lot of different thing it is not like i have been masturbating with the prospect of college life now it ha been two week that he ha become a tyrant and i sit in my room masturbating with the prospect of living my mind is clouded again and i dream of death i told layla she know all of this that if i decide to kill myself everyone will get their own suicide note goodbye all my father is will say is i am sorry about the funeral expense and thank you for killing me because i want to teach him that greed ha made him cruel i am not ungrateful for my father he ha given me an excellent life and although he love me he doe not accept me it would be immoral and disgusting for me to become him to make him happy now i have and do everything i can to keep him at bay but i fear him ignoring my persona and my belief so that thing remain neutral is disgusting to me it is making me depressed layla tell me that it is only another forty day until i leave but i will never be free of him because he is helping me pay and i am incredibly thankful i have him to help me pay all i wish is that my father acted like a father and not an investor p s i just wanted to get this posted i wanted to make my thought known i called suicide hotline two day ago and am alright at the moment the purpose of this post is to verbalize my thought i do not know what advice can be given i just hope someone read this and understands thank you,depression

fired him and his parent begged the company not to press charge for this to happen they agreed everything would be paid back but who paid that money back you ask well my grand parent no no no not my dad is parent my mom is parent and never got a thank you b after that he found another well paid job urther from home so spent the week at a hotel and would come home the weekend obviously we were broke after the incident my mom and i used to go to charity just to be able to get some proper clothes and food while he wa paid to sleep at the hotel and got himself a new car c ffwd to after the divorce the fairy came to visit me for the first time at his new house i wa obviously completely unprepared well that did not prevent him for telling me to buy all the stuff i needed from my own pocket i wa d a year after the divorce he started fighting and saying we were stealing his money when we were only asking for the child support money he owed u by law he managed to get his mom against me great manipulator a he is which completely broke my relationship with her e and now for what completely finished me off and drove me to the edge in april last year i receive a message on fb from someone i do not know i read it and in there i learn that my grand mother had terminal cancer only a few week month left and had been in the hospital for already a year the person contacting me wa one of my gran is friend who somehow managed to find me on fb while reading this i physically felt my heart and my mind breaking i had not seen my gran for year at this point because of the situation my dad created my gran is friend knew the situation but wa still offering me to come and see her at least to say goodbye my mind wa going in all direction at this point why would a stranger contact me about this even though my dad and i have not spoken in more than year i would have still hoped that we would be able to stay civil for family apparently not i took the first plane leaving to france the next monday i am in the uk and went to visit my gran she wa so immensely happy when she saw me at the hospital she would not stop cry and saying how thrilled she wa that i wa there she said she did not dare calling or asking him to call me because it would make him mad she even asked me to send her an invite for the wedding i also even told her i would come back with my fiance so she could meet him sadly we did not get that chance le than week later back in the uk i call the hospital to check up on her i talk to a lady who sends the call to a nurse the nurse asked me lot of strange question like are you sure you are her grand daughter uhm yeah pretty sure i wa even there last month to visit her of course she asked me all these question because she wanted to be sure who i wa before giving me the worst news of my life that my gran had died she wa very ill and quite old so i knew it wa going to happen but there is no word to express how much this hurt what is worse is when the nurse told me that she actually died week earlier wtf why wa not i contacted i then call my gran is best friend where i slept the night when i went to visit my gran week earlier and she tell me that the funeral ha passed a well the tuesday of the past week she had not told me because my dad wa really angry at me the prick also managed to scare my gran is other friend the one that contacted me through fb enough so that she would not call me either to tell me my gran had passed away when he learned that i wa coming to visit my gran he yelled at her like he wa a king and she wa a slave or something wth seriously how can you dare yelling at a person that only acted a a human being telling a granddaughter that her gran wa ill and so i did not get to be at the funeral because of him i wa not able to say goodbye to my gran i do not think anyone ha ever had the right to choose who get to know or not when someone in the family ha died but he took this right somehow and somehow i am sure i am still looking like the bad person in the story he always manages to get his way whatever happens so i am sure that the people who actually were at the funeral heard a completely different story than this and are thinking oh how horrible can she be not even coming to her own gran is funeral the therapy will i think mostly be about this part of thing but i would be interested to hear your thought on the matter how can i deal with this if there are some therapist or other people interested to know about my depression anxiety symptom here are some if you have any advice on fighting any of this a well please do let me know panic attack whenever i am due to go somewhere with people can be the supermarket the pub or even just a friend is house for the day panic attack at work or even just while thinking of going to work even though i love my job motivation to do anything i pretty much stay in bed or on the sofa most of the time no self esteem but this ha been going on since i wa a kid always tired mood swing and i am getting insanely crazy with my fiance he like to go to the pub to relax and see his friend which is completely fine and i am happy for him to do it though it is happened quite a lot now that whenever he mention going to the pub my mood suddenly change and i get in complete angry insane mode for no reason at all not physically just verbally just thought i would precise it i do not want to keep it at home all the time he is helping me so much just by sticking with me of course he ha the right to get out of the house and see his friend when he want to so why the sudden mood change tl dr abused a a child by male cousin and last year my gran dad is mom died without me knowing or even be invited to the funeral i am going for therapy but any thought are welcome on how to deal with those issue,depression

-13.713201,-38.717373,husband told me he love me somebody else this is a cross post from r advice my husband and i have been together for year and married for we have no child together though i have child myself and when we first got together i wa a perfectly healthy year old female over the past year i v been diagnosed with graf disease and have become a shadow of my former self i ca not walk to well these day and because of that there is a lot of housework and thing i do not do my child do not live with u my oldest did until he turned last year but now he and a buddy live together so it is just myself and my husband year ago my husband lost his job and became long term unemployed we eventually during that time had to move across country back to where family wa and we lived with my parent for month then he finally found work and for the last year we have been back in our own place for a while i felt like our relationship had lost intimacy but i attributed it to the stress from unemployment and i thought it would get better once we got back in our own place when we moved i tried to get more sexually active with him and bring back some of our romance the sex is very difficult for me because of the pain i have to deal with i have tried talking to him about these problem but though he claimed to understand he never seemed to put in any effort into revitalizing our relationship about month ago he re united with a childhood friend i have talked to her and she seems like a really nice person but well yesterday or doe it still count a today i am not really sure a i have not been to sleep yet he wa complaining about his phone battery being almost dead by the time he got off work and it should last longer i am a tech geek girl i live for gadget device and computer i have even built my own so anyway i tell him to let me see it so i can tweak it and possibly make the battery last longer that is when i saw them two text message where they both told each other that they loved each other now i trust trusted my husband and up until now he had always been very open and honest with me so i calmly asked him why he wa telling he loved her expecting a rational explanation well at first he said well i do care about her then he started talking about how he felt she would be good for me and i wa like wait what then he clarified he wa talking about a poly amorous relationship now do not get me wrong i am generally a very open minded person and honestly i have had sexual relationship with woman in the past a well a men both alone and threesome but never in a million year did i ever consider doing the poly thing especially right now while my self esteem is very very low because of my illness he told me that if he never talk to this woman again it would hurt him and that would hurt u because he would be stressed and unhappy and he would not be able to forgive me i am dumbstruck i love this man and i want him to happy do not get me wrong i am not completely ruling out poly at all for my entire life but right now emotionally and mentally i am nowhere near in a place where i feel secure in our marriage to explore something like this i am just so confused and so hurt mostly by the deception of him not telling me and being honest with me he claim he wa trying to figure out the best way to tell me the thing is this person is in georgia we are in ohio so physically i know for a fact they have never done anything together because he is never had the time nor opportunity to act on it but emotionally i feel so hurt and drained it is killing me and really i am just so so confused i do not think i have ever felt so alone a i do right now so he say he love me and he want to make our marriage work i told him he could not talk to her anymore i told him that if he ever loved me he would be willing to not talk to her for at least while and give our marriage a chance to be repaired before i could ever even consider something like this and he said he would he did not know it but i wa logged into his facebook at the same time a him when we wa going to talk to her about it we have separate computer and though i did not want to spy i needed to know what exactly his thought were without him censoring himself because he knew i wa over his shoulder i did tell him immediately afterwards that i would been reading their whole conversation and it is a good thing too because he deleted it forgive me i will try to be a accurate a possible a i am writing all this from memory for ease of writing i am going to refer to them in the following manner h husband m her a me h a found our text message and she wa very upset a say she wa more upset about the deceit m a wa right to be upset i have no desire to take her husband while i want this to happen at some point a ha to be ok with it h so let me ask you a question m ok h so it is all three of u or nothing no response for a bit h so if thing did not work out with me and her would you still want to be with me m i am not going to be the cause of your marriage breaking up h well we have been having problem for a while now so if it did not work out it would not be because of you m oh well i did not know that you did not tell me that so you wanted to have your cake and eat it too h no i am just saying that if thing do not work because well they were not meant to be would you still want to be with me m well if it just did not work out then maybe we could work on something slowly h how much do you love me m i love you very much h well a say she want me to back off for a while and spend some time working on our marriage m that is probably a very good idea you need to remember why you married in the first place h ok then so it will probably be a while before you hear from me goodbye my love a few more thing were said but at this point i wa so fuming over watching my husband tell another woman he loved her that i just got up and walked away from the computer i mean to me all this whole conversation say is that he is only backing off because he think that somewhere down the road there might be a chance to bring her into our life i have told him i made no promise i have told him that i may never consider doing something like this i am on such an emotional roller coaster right now one moment i am ok and the next i am cry and yet still again after that i am angry i just feel so hurt and betrayed i mean because of other bad relationship in my life going including my parent i already had issue trusting people i had finally found someone that i could trust and that i thought would never hurt or deceive me and yet he did he still say he love her i honestly do not know what to think about that how can you love somebody you have not even been in the same room with in over year yet still he cried he told me if he did not want me he would have just packed up and left he said he is staying because he love me i am sooo very confused and thank you guy thank you so much for listening to me,depression

-41.193848,-39.78778,my dad left well the title is pretty telling but yes what ha happened to even the best of people ha also happened to me i thought i would be ok with it but i am not ok with it i realize that there are worse thing that could happen of those thing something like this is a drop in a river but i feel a heartwrenching pain whenever the thought of the situation come to mind whenever i reflect on it it take me to a dark place that i have managed to keep out of for a much a i feasibly could but recently it all came crashing through the front door i will be turning in about a month from today and i feel like i have missed the mark in many aspect of my life while under the weight of feeling that i have fallen short of my own and other is expectation it is much too tempting to think that the thing that made me might also have set me up for failure it is maybe unfair to shift the blame of my inability to run my life competently to a small event that had little to no bearing on me a a child my mom wa single for a long stretch of time so there had been the odd scrub here and there and eventually the abusive jerk my mother ended up in an extremely toxic relationship with for year but not once did it occur to me that i had been an unwanted child honestly i had a relatively normal life growing up well to an extent and my father just wa not there to make a mess out of it let alone to offer me any kind of help or support instead he wa simply straight up absent for the better part of my life my parent met each other in a counter culture cult that passed a a christian volunteer organization where they had a brief affair which left her pregnant of me he wa committed to another family so upon receiving the news he decided the best course of action would be to blissfully ignore my birth until the age of my given name and surname were solely those given to me by my mother all of this ha resurfaced due to the fact that after his prolonged absence he waltzed into my life by reaching out to me in via social medium i wa then and did not know what to make of it we have kept in touch and been trying to understand each other in our own term a lot ha happened since and i wound up moving cross country so that i could maybe reevaluate and change the course of a few thing in my life i wa not too happy about meeting him wa par for the course fast forward to today we share an apartment me him and my half brother with whom i seem to get along with just fine since my moving here my father ha been supportive in his own way a far a i can see he is been trying to make thing a accommodating and smooth a possible a for how we are getting on sometimes we get along we talk but never about the real pressing unresolved issue beneath the surface maybe it is best to just leave it buried in the past water under the bridge right it is a can of worm not worth opening and even if i confronted him about it what good would it do what would change yeah i have not the slightest idea of how to approach this sensibly if at all maybe not dwelling forgiving and forgetting is the only way and yet i feel a if he is ignoring me i see him and there is such a stark resemblance i am his spitting image i want to relate to him but i fear that i am looking for something that might not be there i might come off a overly dramatic but i ca not shake away the thought that i am his biggest mistake something he would probably readily admit to himself like i am damaged good defective the weak link that will never amount to much i wa not worthy of his fatherhood what make me worthy now what make me worthy of anything at all it is soul crushing i am sorry i do not know what to do,depression

17.815584,25.156013,breaking down what to do i have been through really hard time last year ending up with me blocking my feeling because it wa way easier to live and allowed me not to just break down all the time basically lot of issue with my schizophrenic and depressive ex gf and my depressive best friend so blocking everything without trying to sort ha become kind of a second nature and now i do not know how to change that and i am just feeling le and le thing the one remaining are love joy sometimes sadness and desperation way more often plus because of all of these i have developed an inability to open myself and tell people how i feel what i think and everything and it is kinda creating problem into my life the only person aware of what i think is my best friend not the depressive one the other but she got her own issue and she ca not really help me about anything for now for example my new gf broke up with me last week partially because of that and i ca not blame her or anything first because that would be childish because i understand her opinion and cannot really disagree with her but because of this inability to speak i ca not tell her how i feel about her and about this decision i tried but the word wo not come out i just ca not do it for some fucking crappy reason and some fucking mental blockage that i ca not erase moreover i am currently failing part of my midterm exam which could result into me being thrown away from the university because of my bad grade in some subject but my parent ruined themselves to pay the scholarship and i just ca not decently fail because it would mean they have done this putting themselves in more poverty than we were before for nothing in addition the more it go and the le i can stand acting a if everything wa normal and i wa really happy of my life because it is not the case i feel like i am just wearing a mask all the time faking my smile and saying that everything is fine while it is obviously not finally i just feel like everything i am trying to do my life end with a failure may it be study couple friend or whatever it is i always find a way to mess thing up i have been having these kinda thought for more than a year without really telling anyone and tonight i just ca not hold it anymore i have been cry for more hour struggled with buying lot of beer and drinking all night long and i have eaten more than g of chocolate while doing this do not judge we all express sadness in different way now it is am and i really do not know what to do the idea of just going back to class tomorrow and pretending everything is ok disgust me but i know this what is more likely to happened p i am not a native english speaker and am really tired so there is probably mistake in this post sorry for that tl dr i am blocking my feeling do not know how to release or express them and it is becoming hard to live with that the amount of thing i am failing give me the impression that all my life is just a failure and a waste of time i ca not stand acting a if everything wa okay in my everyday life anymore i have absolutely no idea of what to do,depression
-37.358932,-24.985054,overwhelmed by everything in my life do not know how to get better warning long post i just attempted to write a detail only post but barely partway through the post wa already huge the only way this is going to work is with skipping proper context for each problem so the extent of some of these issue may not be conveyed properly i have crippling social anxiety which i believe to come from body dysmorphia i developed a a child i have bad teeth that people made make fun of so i began keeping my mouth closed at all time i think this is where not talking began and trying to talk while opening my mouth a little a possible while looking down so my teeth definitely do not show a well a this i wa slightly overweight ended up starving myself after being bullied for year and ended up around lb at i would wear a jacket year round even in the scorching summer to hide my body because i felt fat i am still massively insecure about these thing i joined gym anxiety central and worked out but made little progress due to being so scared of weight gain summer starting and i feel like shit that even knowing how stupid it is i find it impossible to wear normal clothes because i keep thinking how awkward i walk or look the computer usage ha rounded my shoulder and my as stick out a bit and i get really tired from walking it also very rare for me to even go out of my house maybe once a week for an errand ive been putting off for age developed other strange behavior due to such an utter fear of rejection even though i didnt talk so couldnt get rejected anyway blank face always no facial expression or emotion kid have beaten the shit out of me and i would keep my blank face known by everyone in high school a emotionless kid not joking when i spoke it wa an extremely slow and monotone voice only one word answer have tried to work on this developed random insecurity like hand in pocket at all time would not swing my arm when walking because i wa scared id do it wrong still am anxiety stretch to being at home with my family too this is due to my childhood and teen year age mum and dad being insane verbal and physical abuse all day everyday toward each other neglecting me on many level mother brainwashing me into immense fear of my dad and many more thing due to constantly being in fear and anticipating something bad happening a well a thinking of all the possible bad scenario that could happen i developed the habit of extreme worrying about anything and everything all the time never had any friend that i hung out with pretty much just grew up on the pc browsing since i had dial up like year old and playing video game no social experience whatsoever until maybe or to give an example of how bad my anxiety wa i sat next to this really friendly guy in a small class for year for year he would try to talk to me every day and all i could ever do wa sheepishly come up with ok yes no maybe quite literally in the pussiest voice known to man i like to think i have come far since then in term of speaking only because i talk to myself all the time and have imaginary conversation no im not crazy however that is still how i talk to my parent at year old at the sight of them i mentally turn in to my year old self all those year of no discipline left my mind to run free and hence i have no work ethic i have always been good at school for reason unknown to me i have done okay at university so far without attending more than time in year anxiety public transport let alone meeting new people or sitting in a class horrible i think my anxiety all stem from my initial development of it based on my appearance however it ha been reaffirmed to me that i am a good looking guy random girl have hit on me girl have tried to ask me out my awkwardness always destroys any physical attraction take that lady being sedentary for so many year a well a eating so little ha taken an effect on my body shoulder problem back pain all my joint crack and pain after being awake for a while havent slept properly in literally year might contribute to me being so erratic and weird i fear dying in my sleep yeah stupid i know my dad is now year old he ha a heart condition one of the main thing that destroys me emotionally is he still try so hard to talk to me and be nice to me when i know im the opposite of everything he ever wanted i would not play sport with him growing up because i wa insecure about my body i would not go outside with him for the same reason i am year old and i ca not speak to him in more than one word answer my parent also arent very good at english and i literally find it impossible to speak my home language because of my fucking retarded mind telling me i will sound weird or it will be awkward it is like with different people i have different character or self image that i feel they see me and know me a and it impossible to break those but it different with every person and very automatic it make me feel like im fucking insa e i feel like shit everytime i see my parent because i feel like maybe he will pas with me still being a piece of shit son i have also got sister who it exactly the same with barely speak to them and they do not understand why even i do not it like a fucking mental barrier a year ago last june i started writing down every problem i thought i had with myself and tried to work on them my perfectionist attitude and negative self talk quickly brought me into the most depressed state i would ever been i could not really express such deep seated issue to the doctor so easily so he just prescribed me antidepressant citalopram took em for a month couldnt sleep constantly fatigued to hell stopped taking them and realised i did not feel real anymore google depersonalization started smoking weed heavily went through an ounce in a month right before starting the anti depressant so im pretty sure that could have contributed to feel unreal i have quite since then completely different doctor made me quit antidepressant cold turkey no tapering off on jan since then all that is happened is i have regained some energy and realised i feel fucking weird all the time ca not concentrate fucked up memory spaced out all the time i have bought so many self help book and made attempt to try and fix myself but always give up a soon a i have a depressing thought any progress i made is completely nullified anyway now after what feel a very random assorted list of thing i do not even know what specifically i want advice for i feel like i am pretty much fucked over i think that the way i am i will never get a job because my anxiety a well a complete inability to be somewhere on time due to not sleeping and fatigue i feel like my parent will die seeing me a this weird failure child they brought into this world and that is probably the worst thing i will never have a relationship let alone be able to live with someone because i am just a fucking weirdo who ca not interact with others i ca not even make eye contact i have been torn between this all being a bundle of fixable issue like social skill and acting weird being explained due to social isolation and other circumstance growing up or if i just have aspergers or something else and do not realise it i feel like i am the same pussy year old trapped in a year old man body and with the pile of thing wrong with me i really do not know what to do i tried my best to have an optimistic outlook but i have been this way for a very long time and it is just too much i just want to be normal and happy,depression

-36.369198,-26.39558,on a self destructive path this is most likely going to be a long one this is my first day on reddit and i have never had anyone to talk to before i am using this a a venting method really so i am fairly certain that i have been experiencing pretty severe depression lately and i do feel like it ha progressively gotten worse over time to reach the point it at today i have a few theory a to what is causing it but i ca not help but feel completely powerless against the whole thing it is very hard to pinpoint when i started feeling this way mainly because my entire life i have never truly felt genuine when expressing myself to other people i would know what i want to say but would never say it a clich a it sound it wa almost like a voice inside my head word ca not describe how lonely i feel nearly every single day i spend of my day in my bedroom playing game on my computer game from my past mainly always searching for that next big nostalgia trip back when thing were simpler i leave only to go for a cigarette and the occasional bite to eat i do have a full time job though i am actively trying to not become a layabout my job is definitely where i feel the fakest constantly smiling always having a charming and up beat attitude while i serve customer it all just an act it always is and ha been i put up with it because i work in a fish shop and i genuinely do have an affinity with animal especially fish i could not bring myself to harm a fly for someone who is i am actually a massive softie all i ever want to do is help living thing and save them this is where i start to fall out with work quite a lot many fish keeper out there may already know this but for those who do not let me tell you fish shop lose so so many fish per day via fatality there is not really much we can do to stop it it is of the time just the way the fish come into u i feel like this is where i lose hope a lot of the time throughout the day i always say today will be different today is the day your life change a bit hard to think like that once i have euthanized the th guppy of the day all i want to do is save every living thing not add them into a black bag of poison because they broke out into a disease so i get home from work most day around pm and the first thing i do when i get in is reward myself for going out to work all day the reward i will always give myself without fail is a joint weed bud marujiana whatever you wanna call it i do it daily without fail for the last year straight from all i can recall there ha been only a couple of night out of the last where i have actually not had a smoke now i know for a fact that i have an incredibly addictive personality meaning i get addicted to thing really easily but the bud help me cancel the world out when i have not had a smoke i ca not help but feel like every single person around me is just so very fake their emotion their feeling hell even their music taste is most likely warped and twisted and not even their own anymore but that is another can of worm i see this fakeness in literally everybody even my own mother i ca not help but feel that everybody who speaks to me is only saying what they think i want to hear or if it is not then it is an incredibly weird and warped view which just doe not feel genuine to me i would say if i had to fathom a guess at when this all started i would probably say it wa the day i tried to kill myself though it almost certainly started before then which is what led me to try it so how did i do it i tried to overdose myself on ecstasy i figured if i wa going to go out i may a well go out absolutely catotonic now bare in mind i had never even done ecstasy before at this point i decided to neck of them at once i did not know what it would do to me i did not even know if it wa actually deadly or not but i did it anyway alone in my room laying on my back that is what proved to be the most dangerous part now while i wa in this state i could not move i could not speak i could not really do anything i threw up in my mouth and then could not swallow it i wa just destined to lay there and slowly choke to death now a far fetched and unbelievable a it may seem i received a phone call during this time very unusual for me to get call but it wa actually my ex girlfriend she stayed on the phone with me the entire night even though for around hour all i could do wa grunt down the phone to her and she is literally the sole reason why i am still here today i owe her so much and we gave it another go but unfortunately ex are ex for a reason a i found out around a month ago but i wo not talk about that i will let fresh wound fester for a while longer there is so much more i would like to talk about and vent but i feel like i am making this wayyy too long a it is i could genuinely go on and on all day about this but ala reddit is not a therapist i suppose what i would like to say to finish off is that if anyone else is going through some similar shit similar addiction or similar anything really then please know you are not alone there is me out here a well just trying to break the cycle,depression

-24.50563,62.23329,i am slowly very slowly but surely killing myself so no one know it is suicide i m using this anonymous account so the people i know who also browse through reddit don t find out who i am i really don t want my people to know about this but i ve come to a point where i don t know what else to do but ask for help on a social medium in an anonymous way i m gonna try to give the more detail i can without leaving too much doubt about who could be hidden behind those word so i apologize if some of the thing i ll be telling would sound wrong or would need more explanation i m fine with people writing me private message if you feel like you can help in any way possible it s something i ve been meaning to do for a long time now and damn there are so many thing to tell that i don t really know where to begin let s try to start from the beginning i m somewhere between and and i m the second oldest of my sibling i m suffering from crippling depression and lately it s been getting worst and worst i even had to stop working a job i hated by the way because my depression wa so hard to handle that i had multiple panic attack at work i knew it wa high time to do something about it so i finished my contract with them and i just decided to get a little time for myself i m financially stable though so it s no big deal for my partner or myself me not working i started therapy a few month ago i have a session every week and even though it s helping it s definitely not enough i don t feel any improvement in my mental health i d even say that my suicidal tendency have never been more tempting than ever why though let s be a short a possible but clear about it my mother had a terrible childhood and adulthood wasn t that much a pleasure too it lead her to a deep depression she s suffering from even on this day making her insensible to every form of sadness or desperation even toward her child she dated my father while very young and had me quickly afterward but from the very beginning of their relationship she wasn t in love with him she s never been really anyway they still had more child together a my mother is a pure anti abortion woman and my dad s just an idiot the more child they had the poorer we became the lonelier we became too my old man and i never got along so well to be honest i never felt like he loved me or wanted me in his life whatsoever still he seemed to get along fine with the rest of my sibling except for one whom he used to beat and mentally abuse through his whole childhood the violence wa so intense and he had no shame in hurting him while mom wasn t watching that i got to see it with my own eye several time i wa too young to realize what wa happening but i just knew that it wasn t right a we got older the lonely feeling became more and more physical you know like we could feel how our parent didn t have time for u especially my mom she used to work a lot while my dad wa doing sport or listening to music on his own not giving a damn about u eventually they broke up and that s where the real shit started she left home a i wa a teenager found another man and wa on her quest for a new home of hers we had to stay with our incapable violent and inconsiderate dad in the same apartment that she used to live in too at first it wa hard because i felt like i could see her in every corner of the apartment even though she wasn t there anymore but a she kept on not giving u sign of life or advancement in her search for a new home the feeling just faded away when someone even nay mostly your mother doesn t call you or send you text for several day sometimes even week it s hard to keep attached a you were at first that s what it felt like for me anyways i never blamed her for geoing on a quest for a new home i just feel so bad she left u behind too but mom not spending time with me or my sibling isn t the problem in this period even though it became later my old man wa he couldn t bear my mom leaving him so he started drinking having weird frequentations acting more violent even toward the youngest of u but mostly toward me he said i wa the reason mom left because i wa a weirdo let s just say that i ve always been the quiet reserved timid one i enjoyed reading listening to music on my own too drawing and other activity where i can be alone and don t feel like bothering anyone especially my old man who like i said wasn t really found of me and that he should have killed himself on the day i wa born his attitude got worse on every passing day the anger always growing in his heart and mind and a an evidence after several mental abuse physical abuse like pushing me forbidding me to eat the food he prepared leaving me starving in my room alone him spreading rumor about how a whore i wa in our neighborhood he hit me so bad i thought he could ve killed me eventually someone stopped him and i spend the rest of the week calling my mom who wasn t responding hiding in my bedroom too scared to get out when mom finally picked up i got to spend some day with her i felt safer and i almost completely forgot how she abandoned u all this time she told me about this colleague of hers who could take care of me so i could get some time away from home i accepted a i felt like thing were finally turning good for me the guy ended up not being who i thought he wa at all so i preferred going back to my messy and traumatizing family than staying in this place i don t want to get into too much detail about that but let s say i ve been sexually abused a a child a a teenager and been raped several time a grown up when we finally got to leave my old man s home to live with mom thing didn t get any better she already wa way too used to have her freedom and her own life without u that our mental state and our trauma just didn t matter to her i don t really know if it really didn t matter or if she just didn t see it at all but still it wa really hard we were all drowning and still are yet she still doesn t do anything to change that and to help u finally my old man ended up moving away to another city far far from u and give really rare news to my sibling leaving them in this even more painful lonely feeling i don t have any connection with him anymore and don t want to have anyways all this happened a i wa a teenager even the moving to my mom s and the colleague taking care of me my old man left before i hit a i said earlier i m the second oldest just imagine how it felt for the youngest to have a dad moving away not caring for his child and a mother too focused on living her own life today everyone is left with a scar that won t heal wound that will never recover half of my sibling have depression or symptom really close to this mental disease including me and none of our parent care i ve been taking care of them doing my mother s job listening to their problem visiting them a much a i can i even take one of my brother sister to a therapist but i feel like it s not enough i feel like it s going nowhere because the more i try having to deal with my own depression the deeper they fall cause mom barely care she s never been the loving and caring mother and she told u she ll never be it s something she s incapable of doing lately she s been trying to get some interest in our mental state though cause we confronted her and tried to make her realize how important it is that she help u too get over it recover from our traumatic childhood we yelled at her we cried she told u horrible thing i can t share here cause it s too much for me to bear but i know deep down that she s already at her best she just can t do more she doesn t want to this made me realize something one thing and that s where i need you guy cause i feel like i ve already made my decision but still i need to find hope again i need to know if there are any other solution than that it s been clear here that the problem in my family is that no one seems to comprehend one another that every advice every helping hand every comforting word or demonstration of love is just something we ll enjoy from the time being but will automatically forget the day after cause we re just too much used to being alone and sad without anyone really caring about it we re not the type of family that say i love you easily there is no communication no cohesion we re a broken family full of individual living their own sadness and depression on our side too afraid to annoy one another by clearly stating i m not ok please help me and i feel like dying is the only way my family would find that bound that true and powerful bound we ve all been waiting for i always thought that in every situation or almost every when someone dy people gather together and link start to create or recreate between people what if my death is the key for everyone to understand how important it is to recreate or maybe just create this bound my family never had that s why i ve been doing bad shit lately to slowly kill myself cause i am so fudging tired of trying and failing a i said i m seeing a therapist and of course i m taking med i ve been taking too many every day sometimes even drinking while completely stoned by the med i smoke a lot and i shamefully self harm discreet enough so people don t freak out about it but painful enough for it to hurt my body i just don t want to kill myself i m just too scared to do it so i found way though poisoning until eventually i fall into a coma and never wake up i feel like it s the only solution ever to this problem that s been tearing u apart for so many year sorry for the very long post but i need help i really do tldr crippling depression due to traumatizing childhood sibling having same mental health problem dad left early mom doesn t take care of her child no bound in family feel like dying is the only way to make it better,depression

-12.32051,-36.485577,no note i have heard that most suicide do not leave a note i think that is because at that point a person ha already explored all attempt to convey their feeling to others unsuccessfully if there were more to say they would try saying it before suicide i used to put alot of thought into what i would write but i would always imagine the way people would minimize or dismiss my thought and feeling when i read bill zeller is letter i reallized i could never articulate my feeling a well a him and yet even then i saw alot of very negative hateful dismissal of his feeling i have reached a point where i amost never cry and had not even noticed for awhile i do not talk to others about my despair they really do nothing to help but offer some hollow word smithing or irrelevant suggestion this new acceptance that i cannot communicate to others how i feel seems like a step closer to suicide i used to ask one of my friend for a hug but she would give me the hug where she barely put her hand on my shoulder to minimize contact that is her right but i basically felt worse since it seems like she think i am trying to use a hug a a way to feel her up and so i came away feeling like some sort of pretador apperently i have also learned that trying to make conversation with others in public is highly offensive to people now because i am a white entitled male demanding their attention a if i own them great one more thing to give me anxiety when i am around others i am getting pretty off track here anyway do others who consider sucide imagine you would or would not leave a note why or why not,depression

4.076661,64.74614,i realized today that to me the people i love are the people whose death would upset me today is an average day for me i m not in the pit but i m not great either none of this will be the meat of my story i m male and live what people these day call a successful life it s very different but i m just a dude i m diagnosed with ptsd major depressive disorder and existential depression but i try to not let those label control me i wrote that one sentence down and it made me write i ve never shared anything with anyone about this i don t care what response it get but i need to get it away from me i realized today that to me the people i love are the people whose death would upset me i care about them but i don t really feel love in the way that i think most people do the only emotion that seem i seem to feel are one of guilt and remorse while i m depressed sometimes when i m depressed it almost feel good to feel at least that dismay and guilt i remember having feeling and emotion a a child and to truly be engaged in my life i ve recently been able to remember what it wa like to really like my friend and trust them and be able to share thing with them i started feeling that way again in the outdoor community at outward bound where i worked for a bit i wa able to actually be interested in their hobby and their care even there where everyone is accepted and loved especially for their flaw and where i could begin to appreciate other people i still couldn t share anything real about myself over the year i ve become very adept at giving people what they want to feel fulfilled with what relationship box they think i belong in coworkers get everyday bitching and a little bit about what i do in the outdoors service member get story of cool adrenaline stuff a mention that life is a bit rough and maybe mention of deployment extended family member just want to hear that you re doing ok and that s good enough for them my mother and sister get life update picture of me doing thing and i started saying i love you back my close friend know i struggle with depression and know me better than the rest of the people in my life every now and then i let them know when i m having a rough time and what i m doing about it my wife and i talk about my depression when i m doing better when i m not she s the only one that actually know it every single one of these people is tiered and layered a to how close i allow them to get at about i lost trust in everyone around me i ve just now figured that out in the last few week though and a more recent perspective shift ha been that i actually am different in how i deal with people it s important to stress that because i grew up a a white male thinking everything in my life wa perfect and how bad could my problem really be i wa picked on from about at first for growing up poor and then for being different i m sure it wa also how i behaved i began lying to the people around me about anything and everything just so they wouldn t have any reason to notice me at this point i of course thought i wa just a regular kid doing what everyone else doe at i began a phase of i don t care part of it wa a defense mechanism it s hard to engage someone who doesn t care and tell you that directly part of me really didn t care either i grew up sitting at the head of the gifted and talented list so i thought i had a pretty solid handle on what i needed and didn t need i definitely didn t need the people in high school and became abrasively anti social if i wa forced to engage in class that i wasn t interested in i did so grudgingly i didn t want to be around anyone and if i wa interrupted my response wa verbally abusive with the intent to make them never talk to me again i had a clear grasp on how insecure high school kid are except myself obviously and did serious emotional harm to people regularly at graduation time i had a core group of friend i wa still able to talk to them and i felt like we knew each other really well i wa an asshole but i had embraced that and had fully embraced my i don t care mantra when i went to college i realized that no one knew me it wa a fresh start and i could be whatever i wanted to be i stretched some truth left out some detail and put the image that i wanted to carry out there it wa easy and immediately accepted this wa when i first started faking it tile i made it essentially i had a few friend there and it wa very easy for me to be a good person and help them through their emotional issue a they came up they still view me a one of their closest friend and i m really glad because i value their spot in my life i left college after a year and eventually joined the navy at my previous persona got re aligned to be even closer to what i wanted it to be i d become completely adept at manipulating everything around me and didn t think twice about lying to anyone about my past or about who i wa in the military if you say anything with enough confidence it s accepted a truth but i still wasn t myself around anyone and i don t ever give them more of my core than what s safe now i m out of the military i left with good skill and went on to work in the outdoors for a couple of year i m married and work in the electronics industry i took two year away from real responsibility and worked on becoming the person i told everyone i wa while that sound really good the childhood history that i could repeat so clearly and that i essentially believe about myself is all lie it gloss right over anything negative and go right to what i know that target audience is looking for my family that i grew up with doesn t know me a a person i m still close with the guy i grew up with and i know they love me and care about me but they don t know about my depression and even though i know i could talk to them about it i really couldn t i have one really close friend from boot camp and he know post military me but the rest is all bullshit my wife know the most but i still don t feel comfortable going to her when i m in crisis i went to the v a recently to get help this wasn t the first time i m in the system and they know i have problem even when discussing my depression and the full meat of my story except the manipulation part with a psychologist i downplay it and express that i m intelligent enough to realize that a large part of my problem are a disease and that i won t act on suicidal thought my cry for help ended up coming off a a polite request for medication please i realized today that to me the people i love are the people whose death would upset me but i wouldn t feel an emotional loss i feel emotionally disconnected from absolutely everybody,depression

of achievement finish all my homework on time dean is list graduated for all intent and purpose summa cum laude could not be more miserable i scored above most of my classmate in almost everything now i am here at home eight month after school jobless moneyless living with my parent it is like i expected a life pas after graduating highest honor that wa my achievement now retirement is in order i need to reboot my brain to focus on something else a important but i feel like i ca not i am sitting here trying my damnest to convince myself that i am just relaxing waiting for a moment to shine no i am lazy i am not sure if i should be mad at myself for throwing my dedication to something pointless like school or if i should be mad at the school for selling themselves a the ultimate necessity i am not even sure if i should be mad at anything at all if i should just let it go and move on the latter sound more appealing to the poet in all of u but not to those who might feel entitled to something for which they worked i put all of my attention all of my fucking attention into school dropped athletics dropped hobby did not even realize what a relationship wa until my senior year of college all i did wa school homework and video game to relax hanging out with friend wa never really an activity i sought out but then again i usually lived too far away to get to them hell i did not start driving until and only did so sparingly never to visit friend always for some school activity i am a smart kid and i do not give myself credit for that often enough it is like i know the solution to my problem but i am staring it right in the eye instead of tackling it not only that but i have learned that i am a fantastic liar i can convince myself that anything is futile and not worth doing for example i know i need money i know i need a job to earn money i will search for job in my industry and location not find any get frustrated then tell myself i tried hard to find a job no you did not try to find a job you tried to placate yourself if you really wanted a job and yearned for money you would have gotten one taken a job at fucking burger king and shoved your diploma ridden pride in a trash bin but here i sit writing about why i wo not get a job and why i am useless instead of actually applying for job right top that off with a fantastic lack of knowledge of anything i graduated with a degree in medium art compared to my friend i know little to nothing they can list off director actor writer producer etc i have never heard of with little effort my knowledge extends about the length of a very finite textbook i am trying to teach myself memory technique to remember long term but i feel like i have trained my brain to study and then forget in the course of a week just long enough for an exam i only own a forty thousand dollar piece of paper that say i studied film people on this site probably have more knowledge of film than i do i barely know anything within my own major outside my major i know random fact here and there but nothing that could facilitate an improvement in life no hobby in which i might exercise dominance of knowledge no wonder i have recently picked up the habit of telling people random fact only recently within the past two month or so i have had the most fun reciting information i have gathered from reddit and spewed it to anyone who might listen or if the moment present itself in conversation i will proceed to enlighten people on the subject a per knowledge i have gathered once again here and generally on a topic that bear little weight in any sort of future advancement of self haha how pitiful and lastly i know all of this is affecting my relationship my girlfriend is supportive of me and she want me to keep doing what she think i do that is more than i could ever ask for a most people tend to view art degree through a glass of contempt or dismissiveness she hate when i am like this at the same time she is fantastic love me and want me to be driven if you have not guessed by now i do not know how to redirect the drive i allocated toward school toward my own interest it is brought me nigh to tear on a few occasion and there is only so much encouragement she can offer before it feel like she is consoling a wall and i feel she is hit that mark what is worse is i can tell you exactly what will happen after writing this i will feel relief gain inspiration for a day or if i am lucky two do nothing with it then in a month is time consider writing another pathetic apology to the faceless of the electronic world and even better yet you might bring up a brilliant point but because i know everything and my logic is infallible i will argue against it instead of genuinely taking time to consider it why because somehow that is how my mind perceives balance provide the opposite opinion counter the opposing logic to show people the truth is never so simple i am becoming the thickheaded know it all that will die denying the existence of a doorway right in front of me simply to prove i am right how do i do it how can i look past year of training for school without losing everything i have gained and just move forward how can i get out of this rut it is a pattern that is for sure and it happens usually once every two month it is miserable and it make me write wall of

-41.53258,-39.971752,just felt like sharing my mind hey my name is dennis let just say i am quite an emotional person when i wa young i got bullied for let say year instead of helping every school i went to just ignored the problem which consisted of daily fight people filming me while i wa getting bullied i even got beaten up in front of my own house i really had no one and just a the last school promised to help me they tricked me into going to a special school a school for people who messed up their life instead of me being there for week it turned out they tricked me and i could basically never leave there for the school year to come this is where i picked up my depression wa there really no one who cared at this point my parent finally realized that what i wa going trough wa not something i could do on myself they helped me get away from that special school after one year i wa finally allowed to leave that special school but there wa one requirement my parent had to sign a form saying i have pdd no which is some form of autism i do not even have this but this wa the only way they would let me leave that place the consequence of my parent signing that form wa that when i went to a new school the school had to appoint a person for me to talk to who eventually removed the pdd no status for which i am so gratefull all the damage done with the bullying finally cleared up when i wa at least that is what everyone would think because i got bullied allot i am not the most social guy never learned all those unwritten social rule because i never really had anyone to talk to which brings me to the next stage in my life i am now but i still experience allot of problem i feel alone every day i have had multiple girlfriend tough every girl left me in the most scumbag way what is it that make people always treat each other like they are better and always try to hurt the other person when something go wrong let take my last ex for example she had borderline threatened me with a knife and cheated on me multiple time even with my best friend tough i never disrespected her i just do not get it since when did everything became a status symbol allot of girl are looking for the perfect man tough no one is looking for an emotional connection every girl is talking about the perfect man while already thinking about the amount of like they will receive on a picture with him when you meet someone new you are not allowed to talk about who you are or specifically speaking what made you who you are a soon a you open up the bullied conversation you lose your tinder match before they even know you how can you build a relationship with someone who only want to know about your cool thing the thing they can brag about on social medium and make all their friend jealous with i am not here to complain about how everyone is disrespectful i am here to share my mind i have been depressed for a long time now and i know it not the easiest thing to live with although my tip for people dealing with depression is try to look for people who would do the same thing for you a you would do for them i have always spend my life make other people happy why well when i have nothing to live for the least i can do is make other people is life a bit better but never got anything in return to make me feel a bit better my life is not the best one so far and i have struggled with hard situation all my life probably allot of you guy have this problem but try to focus on the small thing we are the one is that truly know what happiness is we can appreciate the good thing more because we know how bad the bad thing can be and if you know someone with depression do not hesitate to send him or her that nice hey good morning text it mean allot to him her this is my first post and english is not my native language,depression

-51.46893,-34.700256,i have been fighting depression alone for year i just wanted to clarify my time line of event here is not perfect i kind of just poured out whatever could come to mind i also missed some thing so the story might not make sense but just confessing this ha helped a bit for many year now i have thought about ending it for myself in the end i never could i always questioned if i wa a stronger person or weaker person for not being able to do it surely most people would say i am stronger but in some twisted way i think i am actually weaker weaker cause i do not have the ball to stick my head in the noose or pull the trigger i have been fighting it for year now when i wa a child maybe my dad left when i wa cop raided my mom and her bf for dealing drug i wa adopted by my aunt thing were always bumpy with her i have always felt like an outcast especially because she had her own son who wa spoiled to hell from our grandparent while i got the handmedowns eventually i got into a fight with my aunt in which they kicked me out luckily my mom wa better from drug she went to therapy so i lived with her and her new boyfriend who wa drug free thing were good for a little while soon enough i had to move back with my aunt because me and my mom is boyfriend did not see eye to eye he would even do shit like shave in the sink and leave the mess in the sink at this point i am so i am getting facial hair he did this knowing it would piss off my mom and she sided with him so i moved back a year later my mom wa diagnosed with cancer and a year after that she died the boy friend no where to be found while this wa going on i found out i had a little sister half sister from my father who i still did not talk to or really see but when i wa around the age of my sister added me on facebook and we kept in touch we even met up a few time to hang out it wa weird and awkward mostly because we knew nothing about each other other than talking but a we grew older we started to understand each other better now shes at the point where shes partying and drinking and enjoying her high school life a nearly all of u did while i mostly worked to try and save up some money to have a decent life i wa boring she started to fall into the wrong crowd doing drug stealing from her grand parent to sell stuff to get her next fix and being the boring hard worker i wa at the time i talked to her and eventually with the help of others we got her back on the right track and she wa on her path to go to college sadly she wa out partying with her friend and they were driving late at night the driver who wa intoxicated lost control of the wheel my sister wa the only one who did not make it our father took it especially hard and he fell into depression himself he tried to work his way through life but ultimately could not take it and felt it wa his fault he went back to drug too then one day he shot himself in an attempt to commit suicide he survived he shot himself in the head but he survived he is recovering now and i have visited him a few time but from that sort of damage you do not recover fully ever and because of the many year missing we do not exactly have a lot in common or to talk about which is mostly me talking because of his current condition after moving back with my aunt from living with my mom thing were better for a bit but it quickly went sour and back to how thing were me being couped up in my room having no socialization with any of my family because it felt like any little thing i did or say would result in me getting yelled at and i wa tired of that eventually i got into a big fight with my aunt and eventually my cousin got dragged in and we were pretty much gonna have a fist fight at the time i work in a restaurant so i had many large kitchen knife just an arm length away i grabbed one to this day i do not think they will ever believe me but i never had a thought about attacking them the only thought wa this is it and i prepared to stab myself but again i could not do it this resulted in me getting kicked out they feared for their life so i wa forced to live on my own luckily working like i did i wa able to save up a bit of money and found a decent studio that the rent wa under how much i wa making barely but enough to get by it felt refreshing and nice i had my own space i could do what i want poop with the bathroom door open walk around the studio naked anything i wanted it wa a small bit of happiness however that ended quickly meanwhile my job at the restaurant wa not going well there wa a supervisor there who she wa rather young and worked her way up the rank quickly she started to let the power get to her head a the other cook agreed upon and she started to use that power to pick on people and make them do her job so she could do nothing and relax one day on thanksgiving night we were open i managed to finish my job for that day i wa only a prep cook for the night and she wanted me to stay extra to do her job being it wa thanksgiving i just wanted to go home to my little studio and relax alone so i said no this angered her but her higher up bos overruled what she wa trying to do so i got to go home the next month wa hell she did everything she could to pick on me even changing my schedule to make me work every holiday so christmas eve and day new year eve and day and my birthday which wa shortly after those holiday one night while she wa barking at me to refill sauce bottle for her at this point i did not want to help purely cause it wa her asking if anyone else at all asked i would more than happily do it i refused and she screamed at me and said i am getting written up i shelled back do it then and flipped the pan that wa filled with ice water to keep the sauce cold of course this wa reported to the chef who immediately sided with her i wa discharged for work place violence but no one ever batted an eye for her targeting other employee and funny enough i recently found out she left shortly after my incident with her now i have a studio with no job and a little bit of saving left depression really started to hit me and for many month i lived there without a job paying rent with my saving i wa in a real slump would not leave my studio for day would not shower or brush my teeth regularly have not had a girlfriend for several year at that point to keep me in check either i would given up on life i tried to get job even small simple one to get some sort of income but nope after a few week or a month i would look at ever possible negative thing about that job and use it a an excuse to quit now my saving is practically gone and i am preparing to become homeless selling off excess clothes my game and other excess thing i would not need but i wa on talking term with my aunt again and they allowed me to move in but i would have to pay rent not a much a it wa before but they made it very clear again i tried to stick with job but just could not my saving wa gone funny thing is they borrowed a lot of money from me over the year she ha a gambling addiction which she wo not admit to and being the moron i wa i let her borrow money from me when i wa previously living with her working several job to try and improve my life a i previously stated fun fact the amount borrowed is over usd so i wa able to let that owed money cover some of what i owed in rent now fast forward a bit i have found a job a good job not the best job not the most glamorous job but the pay is decent and it is not extremely stressful like a restaurant job i thought this wa my first step out of depression however i still experience many episode i still think of the past of my mom my dad my sister my mistake in high school middle school elementary sport i still think about what life would be like if i wa dead wondering would anyone even give a shit would my friend cared i have not socialize with any of them really since all of this happened i do not know if i am even their friend still what i used for my escape wa video game i been playing video game for nearly my whole life my aunt think i am addicted and perhaps i am but to me it is my escape from everything i can stop thinking about the many way to kill myself when i am thinking about my character build in skyrim or that crazy sniper shot i got in battlefield but i am still depressed i know it and i know my health ha rapidly declined over the year because of it i have gained a ton of weight i have had weird heart murmur and get heartburn regularly when i have never gotten it before all the typical depression symptom online match what i experience and my teeth have gone into bad bad shape after i stopped regularly caring for them i have not gone to a doctor in

it towards my aunt i damn near told her straight forward that i have depression but she did not listen and did not believe me so now i have resorted to writing on reddit using a throw away account where i will never touch again i will use my actual account to lurk and stalk here to see what response i get good bad everything in the middle idk what to do but writing this out ha temporarily

-51.07626,-2.2860515,getting mad at yourself for depression hi so i have been struggling with depression off and on for the last year i am now and it ha been more on than anything since i turned when i wa after going away to residential treatment twice for anorexia which i developed around age possibly a a self created form of validation for the intense depression that my preteen self could not understand i became more depressed than ever even than when i had starved my body down to a lb skeleton that wa too cold and dead to do anything other than sit by a fire place with her hand near the space heater i felt my life to be entirely empty and meaningless highschool wa over i had to withdraw from college to go into the hospital and i wa never there really to see what either experience of highschool or college wa really like so i just started eating and eating and eating one day i actually could not stop food wa the only new and formerly unaccessible thing in the world around me that seemed accessible it wa once forbidden by my own self but i didnt care anymore my life seemed to be nothing so i layed in bed that home summer eating nutella and other junk by the jar cutting myself sleeping and leaving once or maybe twice a day to hit up the fast food restaurant like an addict reupping on stock i gained lb in three month then which really made me depressed but i could not do the hiding in the room thing anymore because in spite of how many time i tried to kill myselff i never died so i had to at least do something here if i wa gonna be stuck alive so i decided to check out note formerly forbidden world prior to leaving school and everything i wa an overly involved yet quiet honor student i secretly hated all the dumb prep at my school but did not want to start ant contrevery amongst my very meat and potato loving family so wa apt to having no friend rather than finding friend my family would criticize me for but i did not care anymore my life wa over my parent had pretty much given up on me not to mention my prized possession my once fat body wa now gone i wa chubby and it sucked but with an as and boob finally after all the year i wa starving myself out of puberty guy wanted to be around me now not the right kind of guy but what did it matter i did not care and with them i did not even have to remember myself especially if i could just turn into what i knew they wanted which became easier and easier to do with the more men i hung around it wa almost always mostly the same they would invite me somewhere with a bunch or other people i would get free liquor or drug from them and then utilize the high to pretend that i wanted the guy who invited me once he would try and get me into his bed certain drug made it easier than others to tune out of myself during the sex pretty much forgetting who i wa or what wa happening though sometimes i would get really angry and agressive like start to snap out of the spell and be like why the fuck am i letting this happen so i would just get really rough with the guy because i hated them i hated me i hated everything around me but loved watching some dumb bloke get off on my own insanity after a while of this i found one guy that i stuck with for a while and somewhat transcended the depressed behavior we tripped on a lot of lsd together and it seemed to kind of help atfirst i forgot about my past started finding out thing about myself that i never knew like that i could draw and paint write sing that i wa not who everyone had told me i wa my whole life i began creating a lot of picture filling up sketchbook s like every couple of week finished a semester of college and even lost the weighted i would gained the guy i wa with though who i had since become engaged to started do so many drug that he had to go into the hospital for schizophrenia so i got sober and tried to support him he got sober for a while too but then relapsed really bad and started doing heroine again which he had done before he met me but then stopped it wa really sad but it reached a point where i felt like i wa just enabling him by staying in the relationship so broke it off after a year and a half and the next and a half year well i fell back into any bad habit i would ever had to the max had a few more manipulative boyfriend that actually hurt to break up with even though it hurt just ad much to be with them i had an abortion that wa somewhat forced upon me by threat of the father and really lost my mind afterwards and now it is just a miracle if i get out of bed exercise get dressed and showered and do not binge eat drink or try to overdose on something i have been in the hospital time this last year due to the thing i do to myself when i am depressed i have gained and lost the same lb over the last year a well and just hindered any chance pf moving on through self sabotage today i woke up after a strange string of surreal nightmare and wa still drained i still felt like i wa in another world definitely clueless a to why or how i wa going to get out of bed i did not have anything immediately needing done u wa still tired and very cold this happens often it feel like i am not even in myself and this make mad because in spite of how much i have fucked up my life i do care again i do not really know how to live still but want to become a productive person who work out when they wake up get cleaned up ha a nice house and interesting thing someone who had interest that they go out into the world to pursue someone who can enjoy life without drug or the need of approval from others i do not have many interest nor do i have many interesting thing but i have found a few thing i like to do over the year that is thing that do not hurt me like yoga running fashion reading if my brain can shut up long enough and making art if the inner critic can shut up enough but i only discovered these thing vt getting out of my bed and oyt into the world so on the day i do not feel able to get up i usually say fuck it and binge on sugar until i pas out again well at least that happens when i feel like i need to lsy down but get angry with myself for wanting to rest because do not you know there are so many thing i should be doing because i am never good enough but if this damn depression make me never good enough why even punish myself i am already not good enough mine a well rest even though i feel lije a loser for sleeping til pm on a sunday when i had no obligation s so today i slept until i wanted to do something non destructive more than sleep because that way even if i slept all day the consequence would not be a bad a yelling myself into action ending up binging because i can get really mean with myself and being back in the same place of hatred funny i eventually smeled some soap wafting from the hallway where someone who had just showered wa walking and that made me want a shower i decided that if i wa gonna get a shower i mine ad well do yoga and go to the gym like i wanted even though it would not be first thing in the morning it would be better than confinding myself in some stupid set of fatalistic rule again so here i am writing this at the gym when i wa nearly certain i would still be hermiting in my bed wearing the same pink floyd t shirt a earlier but i am not show how much i know but when i get angry with myself for his i feel i do not even give myself the chance to check out what i could find out it ok for me to have depression even though this disease hurt i do not have become a person who harm there life over it how many of you almost punish yourself for having depression and what are way that you have learned to love yourself instead of being angry for how you are,depression

-76.52228,-25.45422,how can i help my depressed brother x p from relationship advice tl dr i believe my brother m is depressed and i m troubled by my inability to help him i say i believe because unfortunately i haven t explicitly talked to him about whether he ha been diagnosed or how he perceives his own situation we have a sister and my brother spends time with our parent but he is closest to me hence i feel like i would be best positioned to help him at least from everybody in his family what do you think would be the most productive step i could take my brother ha lived all of his life in stockholm like many swede he took very long to complete his education in theoretical psychology he could learn quickly enough but struggled to find the motivation of completing the course and probably felt left out from the university community he graduated at and ha since then only made cursory attempt to find employment money from inheritance allowed him to buy a home and at least for now maintain a reasonable standard of living for my parent work ethic this is unacceptable because he is not providing for himself personally i am most concerned about the fact that he doesn t get the experience of success and work community that he could get from a job my brother ha friend but since most of them now have family he ha become lonely he ha a girl friend but it seems to me that he treat her badly sometimes he will disappear for week and not be in touch with her or he will get incredibly angry over seemingly small detail to me his life seems to suffer from anhedonia the lack of pleasure in thing and a reduced ability of taking initiative a an anecdote he might struggle to choose what to eat for lunch and not eating would make him even more irritated even though he would have the time wit and resource to pursue his interest he remains quite passive he generally go to bed very late around he generally fill his day with sitting by the computer though i m not sure what he doe there one of the reason i don t know is that i find it hard to have discussion with him about very personal thing i am personally very conflict averse so my own intuition is to avoid any topic that might hurt him whenever i start to speak about his future plan for instance he tends to become very silent and barely respond to question at all i feel like he might be embarrassed and i feel strongly inclined to move on in the conversation significantly i haven t asked him directly whether he feel depressed so in our conversation he doesn t take on the status if you like of a depressed person he doe go to therapy and we have discussed this directly with him but i haven t really been able to talk to him about the reason he go it s reassuring that he go to therapy since at least he ha some professional support and potential referral and so forth the type of therapy is psychodynamic so the work is very long term and not necessarily solution focused so i m not certain if it is immediately alleviating his condition he say he find it helpful without elaborating too much through his girl friend i have heard that he take medication one of the reason i haven t pushed him to speak about more personal or difficult topic is that my role in our family ha turned out to be the one who is positive and encouraging i have tried to create the kind of social situation and activity where he could feel positive about the thing that he doe for instance a part of my work i write book and i write software and i have tried to incorporate his assistance into some of these project i have also pointed him towards some of the resource on the web for learning thing such a coding and design and tried to show him a path that would allow him to learn thing and i could eventually even provide him with the gig that would help him earn his own money and i have tried to do this in a way that come from love and an appreciation of his skill and not just trying to help him a a troubled person so i have wondered whether prying too much into his mental health would make him perceive our interaction in a different way especially since he is my older brother maybe it is important that there is a degree of equality in what we do either way these attempt have not gone very far since he doesn t take up for instance the course on the web that i point him towards and his participation in the project that i suggest is sporadic i don t say this in a hostile way i do have a vague idea of what it is like to lose a sense of control over one s own life i too have occasionally gotten completely stuck in my writing work and personal life for month and i too largely hid my trouble from many of those who were close to me because i thought it wa simplest just to power through it by myself so the commonality in these struggle would seem to be an obvious point of connection between u that would allow me to encourage him to be more open and do so in a spirit that would emphasise that he need not feel shame or embarrassment for his situation but i have been simply unable to bring our discussion to this level on the one hand there is still a lack of trust between u and the example set by a relationship of year without talking about the most private part of our life it is also simply difficult to have a discussion about such demanding theme when i am not getting the right kind of reciprocity and response from the other person what make this further challenging is that i live in a different city in london and get to see my brother only a handful of time every year at most all in all i am left feeling quite terrible about the situation i don t think there is any reason for my brother to be unhappy but he is so it is difficult for me to avoid also a sense of unbearable responsibility about it being a person close to him perhaps there is something about depression that i have not understood properly perhaps i am a a sibling ultimately not best placed to support him or is it the case that the situation would simply call for a different kind of approach to communication what advice would you give,depression

-59.17248,38.57658,timeline story of my opiate use from the beginning to today i sort of wish i had kept a diary throughout my use because it would be nice to look back and see all the thing i said i would never do and how long it took to cross those line but nonetheless here is the timeline of my usage which might be interesting for new user chippers and relate able to experienced user august spent a week in hospital in thailand had a private suite a a rich westerner and wa treated like a queen got to order iv fentanyl when ever i liked which wa generally twice a day the feeling of going from pain to that intense nothingness wa amazing indescribable really i frankly loved it slipping into that warm world of no problem and a sort of radiant beauty rushing through me sparked a desire that wa not to be easily shaken looking back it probably a rather strong opiate to try for a first time and especially in such frequent dosage january back home bored saying the weed i wa smoking didnt compare is such a ridiculous understatement i really wanted to capture that heavenly bliss i had in thailand and so i figured i may a well just try some heroin for fun to see if it could compare ended up getting half a gram snorted said heroin and wa completely underwhelmed had break of day in between dos not only did it taste horrible in my throat it wa no where near the experience i had in thailand february after being let down by my experience with heroin and no longer buying into the propaganda that it stupidly dangerous i decided to order a gram and this time do it through iv over snorting i had used needle before for medication im and had someone shoot me up with speed in so i wasnt particually nervous about making that leap i guess jumping from snorting to iv ing in a month is pretty quick by most standard but i really just wanted to capture that feeling i had overseas ordered a box of rig g needle and alcohol swab and injectable water for harm reduction purpose feb contd i found my first iv experience to be fantastic even though i wa missing of time to begin with mostly going through the vein so they were ismall miss i entered that deep body high and began nodding on every shot i only needed to get a strong nod and that made my entire body sweat i would have to take of the majority of my clothes because i wa so damn hot after a shot so nice so blissful the ultimate escape without the paranoia and personality loss that came with cannabis at this point i knew i liked it and figured since i want to keep it just to holiday i may a well just binge in the time i had off so started shooting daily until i ran out once a day march early may studying at university made a promise to myself to only use on the holiday a a treat and kept to it may yay holiday time to order a gram being in australia i wa able to procurer some amazing strong se asian and wa throwing up blurred vision mega high of iv would it wa about a close to that thailand experience a i had experienced to date i really enjoyed it started shooting twice a day generally i think there wa one day i didnt use due to having to spend it with parent but besides that it wa daily until i ran out june early august back at uni ended up getting another gram in my final week at uni in preparation for the holiday had ran out of alcohol swab at this point but figured it would be ok a long a i cleaned my arm with anti bacterial soap before injection late august one week of holiday left and i really didnt want my recent binge to end sold my ipad and ordered another gram and after a day break from my last binge i started shooting again now up to time a day if i could september late november back at uni still kept my word to myself and didnt use while studying early december yay back to holiday reward time also my biggest holiday period of the year got another g but this time it went a lot quicker shooting time a day and using up to a shot now so it went a bit quicker started getting some noticeable scar on my arm started reading this sub a lot more and after seeing that most people just use tap water i stopped using sterile and boiled water and just started using the tap mid to late december well still on holiday got some money through some dodgy mean and figured i may a well keep the party going after a one week break i wa back to shooting up to time a day january still on holiday arm is looking a little worse for wear the track mark are noticeable to me but im not sure if anyone else is aware make the connection had another one week break since my last binge and wa struggling with boredom so got another g got my mark from uni back and wa stoked that i passed all my subject and only have one year left till i have a degree that deserves a reward in my book late january shit ha hit the fan my room mate told me their moving out and that ill need to find a new place my best friend of a decade walked in on me giving a blowjob to her boyfriend of the last year i do not even know why it happened well i sort of do he took advantage of me emotionally not in a rape way and it wa one of the biggest mistake of my life that i regret deeply i do not even want to be with the guy and would do anything to get her back ran out of filter started injecting without filter a my gear asian and pretty pure to the naked eye it dissolve in water so im not too worried for the first time ever im now injecting not to just escape boredom but to escape the really shitty situation of me losing my best friend and about to be forced to move back in with my parent if i dont find a place february ran out of needle had to use one rig a few time until new one arrived in the mail being the lazy person i am i didnt end up finding a new place spent the last few day moving all my shit to my parent house had enough for one shot and just did it here tonight after they went to sleep part of me is kind of happy not to have to pay rent pay for food bill at the moment but in all honesty total freedom is worth the cost of all of those so i will no doubt be pretty bummed out tomorrow pretty sure ill get a gram just to make this transition into living back with the parent manageable losing my good friend and my apartment have me pretty down and i need something to pick me up being in your late twenty at home with your seriously old parent is no picnic late february ended up getting that transitionary gram so i could chill out at my parent place and getting another gram tomorrow because i came into a little bit of money and am a bit depressed havent seen any of my close friend since january cooped up in my parent house getting high every day just waiting until my best friend forgives me started back at university ended up getting a rig ready for my morning class injected at the train station before my lecture for the first time my first rule wa never inject while studying but since losing my roommate and my best friend i guess i do not care a much the fuck it attitude and all that to be continued,drug_addiction

-73.91058,5.4614997,the ideal opiate addiction treatment you can think of so it is clear that the state of opiate recovery in this country is archaic the shit i have seen at the methadone clinic disgust me the nurse do not know shit they give you no warning whatsoever before taking away all your take home without any thought to the consequence that might bring they do not even let you split your fucking dose unless you do blood work proving you have a rapid metabolism and if not you are fucked it should not be about that it should be about how you feel i would not have been able to do my taper if i did not split my dose on my own but anyway i am sure with our vast experience on the subject we can think of much better way to treat opiate than the current mantra my method would be slow release transdermal desomorphine patch maintenance now bare with me sure it is the krokodil drug but there is really nothing wrong with it if it is pure the reason this would be the best is that a patch ensures hour of comfort even when i wa at mg methadone i still had wds in the morning on top of that desomorphine ha such a short half life that you could get off it anytime you wanted with the right drug like gabapentin and clonidine for day and then your good to go stay on the dm patch until your craving have gone and then taper down a bit and you could stop at any time rather than a year hellish methadone taper taper half way down on the dm patch and jump off and bare the day wds with methadone and sub you are just fucking trapped there is no other option for you a the wds last a month it is a damned prison which taper is the only way out of it could even be used a a transitory method from methadone maintenence to sobriety take methadone for month or so until you are sure your craving are gone make the switch to the desomorphine patch to make the taper process easier low enough of a dose to not give you a high and since it is a constant release patch you would not really get high you would just constantly be fine sure there is a risk of people abusing and selling the patch but it should be a risk we are willing to take what do you think would be a better way to treat opiate addiction than the current practice there must be a better way there ha to be heroin maintenance oxy maintenance hydro or codeine maintenance,drug_addiction

a good time but at the end of the day i am not really able to talk to any of them about anything deeper than the weather or whatever most of them have not even gone through puberty yet i have a lot of internet friend that my little sister often refers to a my penpals because i talk to them on a basis frequent enough for my little sister to be familiar with them what a loser and i ca not really talk to most of them about much either but i get a wider array of thing to choose from than from the kid in real life most of them are also at least a few year older than me which i think kinda help in whatever twisted way it doe they are at least a little more interesting i have never been like other kid my age and i know the kid who say that are always the one who are exactly like the other kid their age but i have really always been different and i have always been really good at hiding the fact that i am different i read a lot book essay poetry and article in the economist and foreign policy about thing i at least find vaguely interesting for a while until i realise i have not got anyone to discus them with i listen to a ton of indie rock band then i get a little upset when none of my friend in real life really want to hear about how great i thought this album by some band they have never heard of and are not interested in hearing of wa i do not even act awkward about it i just avoid thing i really want to talk about and let them have a fun time instead of having everyone be miserable and me look like i live under a blissfully unaware rock i even pretend being interested in thing they like so a to not be alone but it really make me feel more alone than ever i really do not like katy perry or the hunger game very much to tell you the truth i i play a lot of instrument i

him again not up to me this time we always have little argument that always end in u acting like we like each other a lot again but it went pretty far this time and i do not know not up to me but yeah just wanted to add that she is never really asked about it because she doe not really care because her job is to make me want to go to school again not to make me happy forever since that is all my parent are interested in so they can have a happy and normal looking family without a socially awkward daughter and lalalala also this is a throwaway because i do not really want reddit to know i am

this i have only told a few friend some part because most of them have their own issue to deal with and i do not want to burden them with mine too in hindsight pushing this on stranger seems even more selfish but i do not know what else to do anymore also i am not a native english speaker just to mention that this is for anyone that want and can listen be warned that this get increasingly dark and fucked up towards the end i have been trying to write a tl dr version for half an hour now but i simply ca not year old and i am stuck i have been suicidal i still am but not in any risk of immediate suicide i know that sound weird but it will soon make sense i have been battling my own inner despair for almost year now right now i have become aware that i have started to shut down emotionally i could not care le if i die or not but i do not want to make anyone else sad and i am both a stubborn and analytic person so i guess you could say i am not in immediate threat of suicide that i am aware of maybe i do not know anymore i have been thinking of suicide a lot lately but it doe not feel like i will do it there is no reason for it yet what i am worried about is other people around me it just feel like i went through so much shit in the past year that my own mind is shutting out any kind of emotion that doe not help it survive i do have two emotion remaining that i can still feel rage and love thankfully they are not both directed to the same person and ironically i think they are both keeping me alive but one of them might kill me soon both are my fuel right now but it is an uncertain existence if i lose my girlfriend for whatever reason i am only left with rage or if i lose control of that rage for whatever reason i lose everything i know i could not live with myself if i hurt anyone else i simply could not but i ca not seem to dig myself out of this hole anymore so right now i am pretty sure i might hurt someone and then end my life or end my life in fear of hurting someone it is fucked up to even read it written like this but it doe not even come close to how it feel it is hard to explain a combination of effort injustice and fuckup some of mine some from external party led me to the point in life where i am now so i guess i will go like that it will be long because i am just not sure what is important anymore i know i need help but i ca not seem to get it i asked for it went after it and basically got my ball crushed i guess i will start with my family and where i live i live in a european country where the primary two solution for any mental healthcare issue are a suck it up and stop being a bitch b get stigmatized by the entire community local or national very little difference then be considered and treated a a crazy person it is basically like this if anyone ever find out you are on something like anti depressant they will actively avoid you and start looking for excuse to fire you if you work for them i am a product of an arranged village marriage no i am not joking i grew up in a small and frankly beautiful village but my actual family is anything but beautiful my mother wa married to my father when she wa pretty much without her consent in exchange for a goddamn house right now she is a mental mess and she can be downright venomous without thinking she developed a temper and is quite an expert when it come to guilt tripping and verbal abuse but i guess she ca not be blamed for being like that it is a consequence of everything she went through my father is a hard worker but always took my mother and pretty much everything else he had for granted he is a war vet and an alcoholic he is incapable of empathy regardless if drunk or sober and stubborn a hell we fought and still fight a lot at time i do not see him a a human being anymore he seems like an empty shell of a man he got his first job through his father connection but he ha not made any connection for himself he just did what he wa told and never thought for himself he wa at risk of losing his job over year back on account of his drinking my sister and i both lied for him tried to pull him out of trouble pulled a many favor a we could we got him into a rehab program he did not drink for a while maybe month or so then he went right back to his old pattern and still lost his job his job wa a major source of income for our family so we started struggling hard all our saving were bleeding out slowly i wa still employed at the time he is the source of my rage but ha not been a target of it yet other than verbally i have been unemployed for year now year ago i took on a job a a security guard bodyguard in another city just to get away from my family i lived with my sister for a while then got my own place life in general wa good other than the fact that the job wrecked me physically shift were in standard hour block due to fucked up regulation allowing something like that in our country and on average i worked anywhere from to hour a month i gained a lot of weight really fast and ended up with knee surgery the surgeon messed something up and i wa still hemmoraghing in my knee for several day after the procedure it wa initially an arthroscopy procedure and they did not want to open my knee up fully so they basically drained blood through puncture and whatnot not sure what the exact medical term for it is in english this mark the first time i had trouble with doctor in my country after that year ago i took another job in one of our major telecom call center straight from my old security guard job with no break inbetween it wa a nice job initially steady hour shift i advanced to call center manager within month i actually got a lot of experience from my old job related to it but that is another story and the pay wa more than adequate for me to live comfortably unfortunately within the next month thing went to shit nationally our company changed sale policy then introduced insane sale quota for call center we could not reach daily quota in hour so they pushed our department into overtime for week hour per day of course we did not get fully paid overtime since regulation in our country are shitty this lasted for month until i broke down i just could not get myself out of bed one morning my body felt like it weighed a ton long story short i wa constantly tired could not focus on anything anymore not my job or my personal relationship everything suffered my company started blaming me for loss and eventually i heard that my regional manager who pushed u all so hard wa trying to shift the blame on me with the possibility of pay severance i could not get out of my slump and i basically quit my job a month after i heard that during the time all this shit wa flying around on my job i wa also helping my father with trying to not lose his job went to see my doctor and did some general test everything ok but eeg which had a borderline result that pointed to epilepsy for some reason they gave me some med and sent me on my way told me to check back in day or so i got worse in addition to feeling like a truckload of tired shit i now started getting memory blackout i would forget what i wa trying to do or simply find myself in another place without knowing how the hell i got there went to an emergency checkup did some more specialized test no anomaly no tumor no blood defficiencies nothing they gave me more med one of them wa an anti depressant i got worse now in addition to blank in my memory and chronic fatigue now i wa also getting cascading full body cramp this wa the worst pain i felt in my entire life a part of my body would start to cramp up randomly and then it would expand to my entire body within a minute it wa not just the pain that i remember i bit through my tongue once thankfully not completely in half shat myself twice and broke two of my upper front teeth replacing them wa expensive a hell and my sister had to help out financially i moved back in with my parent since my saving dried up and it wa risky for me to live alone due to those cramp and memory blank there wa no internet at their place at the time so i went a full year with minimal contact with the outside world i lost touch with most of my friend doc replaced some of my med but nothing changed my thought felt scrambled my body occasionally tried to tear itself apart and this wa already lasting for a year with no positive result i wa at my low point i had nothing left and for the first time in my life i genuinely wanted to kill myself for the first time i felt the feeling of true despair i told that to my sister and my parent i told them that what the doctor are doing doe not feel like it is helping i fought against my own mind and tried my absolute hardest to form what i wanted to say a a coherent subject it all just resulted in several huge fight where they concluded that i should be ashamed of myself and told me to suck it up let is just say it all just made my rage fuel tank bigger a month passed and i told my parent that i will spend a weekend at my own place so i could find some stuff on the internet i wa not exactly lying i just left one thing out if i did not find what i wa looking for a way out of all that shit i wa going to kill myself then i had no girlfriend at that time nothing left that i would value and i decided that if i wa ever going to end it all it had to be then since my parent could still afford my funeral those were some of the thought i clearly remember from back then so i went back to my place started researching everything related to my medical result the med i wa taking and the symptom i wa having while i wa researching that a friend noticed i wa online and asked if i would be interested in working for his company a an seo copywriter he wanted my reply within the next week and i said i am definitely interested but i needed to check something else out first the pay offered for the job wa enough for me to live independently again but that would only be possible if i solved my other issue after two day i decided that i am going to just stop taking my med cold turkey i needed to start working in week but my next specialist appointment wa a month and a half away i could not hope to work for him in the mental state i wa in under those med so i basically decided to take that huge huge risk if i could have gotten an appointment sooner to start gradual med removal properly i would have there wa just no other option at the time i would either miss my chance with that job and continue being in that miserable state or risk going cold turkey with med that have altered my brain chemistry and finally start moving forward again i still think i wa really lucky because i do not notice any long term consequence of going cold turkey like that but i would never ever recommend something like that to anyone if there is another option brain chemistry balance is nothing to fuck around with my desire to move forward just outweighed the related risk at the time i wa right other than feeling that same overwhelming fatigue if i push myself too hard none of the other symptom showed up again life wa ok for a while i had enough to live by myself i found a new girlfriend but it all did not last for long first that seo copywriter job wa soul sucking my friend just saw a chance took it made good money initially and then tried expanding too much too fast he started asking more and more for the same money and he got into trouble this is also something that got me into trouble down the road in any case his paypal account got blocked and he could not pay out the worker from my country and asked if anyone could help him transfer the fund i offered my help since he wa a major part of what got me moving again in life he transferred some fund onto my private bank account i split those fund and sent them to the other worker a requested everyone seemed happy and that wa the end of that it wa not that is the first decision i regret month later his company start failing and he cut our pay drastically i am talking about a cut then he start looking for workforce in other cheaper country and try to get me to still write and train new people i bail out and quit not wanting to push myself over the edge again despite the local economy being absolute shit and no job being in sight i just valued my health more at the time i could deal with living with my parent for a while again a long a i did not have any health issue a month after i moved back in with my parent i start feeling lump under my tongue several of them small round very hard for the first time in almost a year i go visit my doctor i do some test tumor confirmed malignant a in bad not sure if that is the correct term cancer basically but my doctor wa not done with delivering bad news turn out i did not have any kind of health insurance anymore and she did not know why the next day i managed to find out why i lost my health insurance turn out our law and regulation were even more fucked up than i wa aware of since i wa oficially unemployed working a an seo copywriter for my friend turned out to be a grey job so to speak and the unemployment bureau kept track of my bank account it got auto flagged the moment a suspiciously large sum of money wa deposited in it you only get classified a an unemployed person until you reach a certain average monthly income quota which they track over your bank account i went over that average the moment my friend paycheck money wa deposited on my account now here is the catch the bureau ha no obligation to ask about such transaction or notifiy you if they take you down from the unemployment list their default course of action is to remove you from their unemployment stats after all they have one le unemployed person to worry about it is a win for them you can have health insurance even if you are unemployed in this country but when they take you off the unemployment list you have to apply for health insurance again within a certain time period or you lose it until you find a job so i did not know i wa no longer an officially unemployed person i did not apply for health insurance again in time and i lost it i needed to have tumor removal surgery a soon a possible but i had no health insurance i did not have even close to enough saved up either we eventually make a contract for payment over a period of year and i do the surgery i told the entire situation to the friend that got me into that mess and he said he will see what he can do he offer to lend me some money it wa not even a th of what i needed to pay for surgery but my whole family wa pretty much bankrupt at that point and i accepted that is the second decision i regret we agreed that i will start paying him back a soon a i get a job the sum wa about in local currency it is been almost year since then i still do not have a job i have applied to almost a hundred job in that time period only got a reply for job of those job i got stiffed for pay on a in i did not get any pay for month while the third wa a heavy construction job with work hour where i literally ended up pissing blood middle of summer doc said it wa dehydration and quitting the same day it happened i lasted week there at least i got health insurance again the friend that lent me about he is now threatening me with legal charge and loan shark he is also in debt and apparently started doing drug so i actually consider him dangerous right now he started threatening that he will show up at my parent house i do not know what the hell i am going to do if he doe that i am not on good term with my father but my parent are still my parent if he show up or threatens them in anyway i am afraid that i wo not be able to control myself i literally have not been able to pay him a single cent back in the last year i have nothing and have had nothing in the past year the pitiful amount of money that i managed to earn all went straight into paying bill for my parent since my father is still unemployed i am basically dead weight for my parent my sister is helping u all out but she is expecting a second child soon and there is no way she can help me i have not met with any of my friend for over a year and a half not even for a beer or coffee i just ca not afford it most of them are in their own pile of shit too with the national economy being in the dumpster a for my girlfriend well she ca not help me either she life in another country and there is nationality issue due to there being a civil war over here year ago her parent are absolutely opposed to her relationship with me but she love me to bit and i love her too and just to make everything even more absurd she is living within a couple of mile of an uncle who molested her when she wa a child around year old she wa also raped by a group of stranger unrelated to her uncle during an evening walk when she wa year old god i wish i wa making this all up i am not sure what is the point in even writing all this down i just do not know what else to do writing it all down for others to see is the only thing i have not done yet and now i am here where i am now nowhere again stuck in full blown despair again but also angry now so angry at so many people and i have no idea if i can control it all much longer so i am just scared i will either hurt others or hurt myself or hurt others and then myself i have no idea what i should do anymore this time i simply do not see any opportunity in sight i keep applying for local job and no one reply back i ca not apply for job on a national level because i simply ca not afford moving or living anywhere else with zero saving of any kind i wish my thought would be scrambled now since at least i would be able to sleep i wish this all would just stop,suicidality

-88.32487,-29.26244,life is a joke in light of robin williams death and after a review of world is greatest dad i have come to the conclusion that he likely did not kill himself and rather died accidentally either way the gif of him from the movie saying to seek help and that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problem ha gotten me thinking the context of that clip is completely contrary to the message of the clip and society including and especially redditors are seeking validation and approval like everyone else our thought are not unique our emotion are sham created for emotional and in the worst case fiscal profit so the quote is right but the message the hive mind ha derived from it is wrong the problem s are not the depression and anxiety that drive someone to suicide the problem is life life is meant to perpetuate itself and destroy the thing that are not alive and convert them into life robin wa a fucking genius for killing himself because we have no right whatsoever to interfere with dead inanimate thing than we do with living thing what do all living thing do they fucking die see you in hell you clever bastard i am rift behind you,suicidality

-61.224075,11.134255,my suicide attempt maybe it can help others when i think about when i tried to commit suicide it is at once both a distant fog of a memory and a sharply present experience it is both watching a stranger and myself do these action well where to begin the big catalyst were breaking up with my girlfriend of year and being laid off from my job within two month i spiraled pretty quickly out of control i bought crystal meth from a friend and started doing it almost every day a i survived on unemployment check i got little job here and there a i wa a web designer there wa always a bit of work for me i went to all night coffee shop and wrote and obsessed about my ex i wa brutally and hopelessly depressed i drank i started smoking this is coming from a guy who wa the picture of health i used to run go to the gym eat healthy i did not think this lifestyle wa having an effect on me later i would hear from my sister that when she saw me for the first time during this period of my life she thought i looked like a skeleton i started going to therapy after crystal meth though i did get hooked on pain pill i stole from my roommate at the time but eventually those ran out and i had no choice but to become somewhat sober my therapist meant well but i lied to her trying to be the person she wanted me to be i did get a job and felt like i wa getting better what set me off next wa seeing my ex after a few year seeing the house that she bought the house she wa living in with her new boyfriend seeing how happy she wa and what the fuck wa i doing i got pain pill valium and cocaine from several source and began using all the while lying to my therapist about it i got into a car accident going to work while i wa high on valium nobody wa hurt so the cop were not called there were to be no drug test i started hanging out with a guy who partied a lot we would go out to club and do a lot of drug and try to meet woman i shudder to think how i looked to those woman high on coke and alcohol reeking of desperation the main thing i can say about how it all lead to a suicide attempt wa it felt like a snowball rolling down a hill i knew what wa happening but there wa nothing i could do to stop it it wa going to end one way or another on a saturday everything felt dark i felt like i wa underwater there wa so much pain inside of me i did not know what the hell i could do so i took valium and pain pill and i drank vodka from the bottle i stumbled around my apartment and still i hurt i did not want to live this wa not life all this pain i called my friend and left a message on his voicemail do you ever think of death i grabbed a belt from my closet but could not find anything to hang from myself from so i drank some more i wa so completely out of it i thought i would die soon from all the drug i went to bed and laid down face down into my pillow hoping to suffocate if the drug did not kill me then i blacked out when i woke up the next day there wa the deepest grief i had ever felt i failed i did not want to be alive i hated everything i grabbed a knife from my kitchen and dragged it across my forearm not to kill myself i just wanted to feel something besides the pain inside of me it made me feel better i called my therapist and told her what happened she wa not pleased she told me to call a friend over otherwise she wa calling she also told me she could not be my therapist any more that she could not handle me at the time i thought it wa harsh but i did not feel anything i wa dead inside but embarrassment overrode everything and i called a friend lest i be hauled out of my apartment by emt in front of my neighbor my friend came over clearly over her head she did flush my drug down the toilet which i know appreciate if she had not i probably would have finished the job that night she cried when she wa the cut on my arm and all of a sudden i wa comforting her i am not really sure what happened after that my memory is pretty fuzzy from all the drug but being off the drug probably helped a lot i plodded along i found no joy in anything for a long time somehow i hung on long enough to realize that my life would not always be that way and that wa the hardest thing to believe because when i wa ready to die i thought that wa my only option i do not know what advice i can give about coming this revelation yourself maybe you need to get that close to the edge before realizing you do not want to go over and some people make it and some do not i think about killing myself every now and then still but it is fleeting and not very real a fantasy a day dream it is been year i love life even when it suck because fuck it that is all we know we have if you are out there if you are thinking about offing yourself i am not going to give you a list of bullshit reason not to to tell you the truth only you can figure out a reason to live but it only take one reason one spark to keep going and if you make it one more day hour or minute that is something do not think about the rest of your life think about this moment well that is all i have to say send me a message if you need someone to listen good luck tonight my friend,suicidality
