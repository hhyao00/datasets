6.6566744,-52.672802,"day the sobriety euphoria has ended and life can suck sometimes, but i do not think i will ever go back to smoking i am on day , and the paws post acute withdraw syndrome euphoria has certainly ended. i have been tempted to smoke many times in these days, not just from myself, but by being surrounded with friends who smoke even going on trips where joints were passed freely and i chose to turn them down . i am no longer bouncing with euphoria, and i have had days or chunks of days where i have had incredibly low energy or have been outright depressed. but you know what? when i think back on how it was when i was smoking, it is still a whole other universe better now than it once was. just like weed did not solve our problems or make us really happier, being sober alone ca not do that either, and that realization is no reason at all to just give up and smoke again. in the last month, i have grown more, taken on challenges and moved my life forward, and felt better about myself than i have in years. and most of all, even if i feel down at times, i am actually able to motivate myself up and shake myself out of it usually in just a few moments to a few hours, or at worst over a day or so in a way that honestly felt impossible while i was smoking. while life is hard , weed made it impossible for me. and no matter how hard any given day is, no matter whatever setback or reason i can get really sad, i ca not say that i am ever really hopeless anymore. i have had some moments feeling hopeless while sober the feeling may come, but it goes within hours at most. if i were to quantify it, every single day i spent when i was smoking i could count more hours spent feeling miserable than i have felt in this whole last month. a day is worth of pain in smoking, spread out over a month sober it is crazy when i think about it. and when i think about the depths of despair and absolute misery i was when smoking versus where i am now, just that alone motivates me to keep clean, no matter the temptation. whenever i am tempted by weed because the allure to check out for the rest of the day and get high can be appealing , i just remember where i was before crying in bed, crying in the bathroom at work or in the car driving, how i would get to work and basically try to force myself to let hours drown away just to get high in the evening. any time the thought of smoking comes to mind, i no longer block out all the consequences and just rush to the bong, i think about the aftermath once the hit wears off and it helps me remember that no matter how hard something may feel right now, i am still at a whole other level better than i ever was when smoking. it is strange, because i went from smoking nearly every goddamn day for years, to never wanting to touch the stuff again. it is no longer something i associate with pleasure, but with pain. thoughts of smoking may come, but the pull just does not anymore.",addiction

1.1973683,100.05956,"this page has helped me a lot so here is my story as a thank you i am turning in august and i have been abstinent from marijuana for two days now after a year period of use. i know it is not a good excuse but i did grow up with a brother who was a heavy smoker cigs and weed drinker, my mom is an alcoholic i see her drunk off vodka nearly everyday and my dad works a lot but gets slam daddy wrecked at the end of the week so i guess you could say addiction runs in the family. on top of that all my friends in high school were heavy smokers, smoking amounts i could never dream of at the time. i would say that the last years have been pretty heavy, smoking morning noon and night to sleep and eat and before i do anything. i bought an expensive volcano vaporizer early in my addiction and i was able to get high way more often until it got stolen at a party and i picked up bong toking. eventually i bought another volcano these things are like and i did not even think twice about it which i now find sad. i have been working at walmart in the produce department for about four years now, and weed never debilitated my ability to go to work at all but i am damn sure it effected my mood and how i was just waiting for the day to end to indulge. i bet the motivation that kept me working was that i needed the paycheck to fund my habit. i have also been able to complete a four year degree in environmental studies but my average was mediocre to say the least and i am now about months after graduation and noticing that this degree is not really helping me get a job, either because my motivation is just not there or because i never really applied myself anyways and could have taken a more applicable degree if i was not high all the time. maybe i could have actually done my math homework in high school and become a doctor like i have always wanted to be. now throughout my years of use, i have really only abstained during trips i went on. currently i have been sober for days and i am in miami away from the bitter cold of toronto where i am from. i find traveling helps a lot with cravings because you can find something to keep you preoccupied. i grew up in a small town north of toronto named bradford where the stoner population in high school was pretty prevalent although i guess it could not be any different anywhere else . after i graduated university and celebrated my birthday in august i went to vegas where i was able to abstain for a week as well. when i returned home i was in the process of moving away from my family in bradford and into a basement apartment with a good friend of mine in toronto this was proven to be a real bad idea . after that abstainance period in vegas i thought i could continue it in my new life in toronto by finding a new job and progressing forward in life. and i sorta did for a while until i was stupidly peer pressured into a smoke at a concert which spiralled me into addiction again because i had just loved the feeling of munching out. besides that vaping everyday was reinforced by the fact that my good friend roommate got on my nerves like everyday whether it be leaving dishes or clothes everywhere and playing loud music into the night preventing me from sleeping. and of course being as high as i was, i would tell him these things annoyed me but i was never assertive enough to help my situation out. my addiction was even more reinforced by having the vaporizer bedside and being in toronto where now, weed is too easy to get. nonetheless, the withdrawal symptoms have been too real. i was soaked in sweat last night and i had the most insane dream that a cop was going to arrest me for vaping and at another point in the dream i was about to pack a dank bowl like it was so vivid i could almost feel and smell how good this weed was but i ended up putting it aside willpower in my dreams? il take it . the first day i quit before i left toronto i woke up with an insane headache. i can probably say i have experienced a lot of the symptoms many of you have already stated. in terms of depression though i do not really feel much and i feel like that is mostly from reading eckhart tolle books the power of now, a new earth . after school ended i delved into personal development a lot but still getting high while learning all this stuff must have been counterproductive in some way. medidation helps clear my unwanted thoughts as well, it is just i am usually selfconcious and ca not meditate if people can see me. along the lines of self development, i was also driven to quit because my love life is just soo bad. i guess i was in zombie mode and never gained the skills to properly socialize with people also smoking all the time caused me to be very antisocial as many others have noticed . i have had two girl friends in my life and both relationships never lasted longer than a month and it is clearly due to the fact that i was so comfortably numb. to basically sum up, i would just like to thank everyone on this page because i read this whenever i have cravings and it helps tremendously. makes me realize that i can do so much better and i am actually thinking i can kick the habit for good. if you happened to read my whole post, then even more thanks to you. i have never revealed myself in such a way before so i think this is going to make a lasting change because reading over this, i am noticing where i fucked up in life and how i couldve done so much better. feel free to reply with any encouragement or comment you think may help my situation or if you want to know anymore of my story.",addiction

16.581942,-11.286368,"day thoughts, comments, tips and questions today marks day of not smoking. this is the longest i have ever been clean through my own choice. before this i had pretty much smoked every day for a good years. the only times i had not smoked were when i was prepping for drugs tests months clean for hair tests, times on vacation when i could not find any or when i was working i would work for weeks straight at a remote facility with no access to pot . as i said though, this is the only time where i have made the decision to stop smoking and i feel so empowered. i ve always loved smoking, but i definitely used it as a crutch to escape from my problems in the world. it was easier to smoke and say fuck it then deal with things head on. i ve missed a ton of opportunities to go out, meet people and have fun because it was always easier to stay at home. i ve lacked the drive to pursue my interests it always being easier to just go with the flow. i think smoking is a major reason my life is at its current state where i am not happy and angry all the time self loathing with every decision i make. i took a career path that i hate and was pushed on me by my parents. it conflicts directly with my personal beliefs it s in oil and gas but it was easier to pursue that than to work for something i really wanted. i ve lost so many opportunities with women due to living in this little bubble of fear and rejection, directly propagated by smoking. now i m working on changing my life to suit my needs and do what i want. its great! anyways, here s my week update so i am going completely sober no pot, no booze and no other harder drugs. minimal caffeine i only drink tea on work days . for the first days or so i had terrible night sweats. i ve had this in the past while coming off and to combat it i wear snug fitting cotton clothes like long johns and long sleeve turtle necks. i still would wake up damp and uncomfortable, but it was loads better than being drenched and miserable. sleep is still kind of tough for me. i ve been falling asleep alright, but i still wake up every few hours. i can fall back asleep, but in the morning i m usually exhausted. does anyone else have this problem? do you know if it something that might fade over more time? i would really love to sleep straight through the night. i also had a huge decrease in appetite and some nausea the first week or so. my appetite has slowly picked up to an acceptable level and i am no longer nauseous. i don t know if it helped, but i would exercise frequently and i think that assisted in building back my appetite. another thing i do is hot yoga and i think that sweating hard has helped flush my system faster. one question, i ve noticed that i m much more winded when i work out now, has anyone else experienced that? i used to work out high and sober, but now running really takes it out of me. hopefully that goes away. i ve also noticed that i have headaches pretty frequently. has anyone else experienced this? they are subsiding in intensity, but i still get them every day. i feel it in the back of my head, i guess i m still detoxing somewhat but i d like for it to subside. any advice or comments on that would be appreciated. i haven t felt any incredibly strong urges, but boredom was a little issue in the beginning. to pass my time i am playing video games or writing, i also work out and do house chores. i try to keep busy all day and when i do, time seems to fly by and i usually don t even think about smoking. as far as support, i haven t really told anyone i m doing this except for my long distance girlfriend. i never understood the people that would say they were quitting and then be back to smoking the next day. i have probably kept this to myself out of fear of being labeled a quitter if i should fail. and as for my gf, she said she was going to join me on my plan of sobriety and that we would be accountable for each other, but i m pretty sure she is back to smoking too. which is ok, because i know how hard it is to quit myself. but i never planned on using her to support my quitting i am carrying the load myself and for myself. whether or not she smokes is irrelevant to what i m trying to accomplish. with that being said i do try to give her support and talk to her when she s called saying she s feeling the urges try to get it off of her mind and get her to occupy time with more constructive activities.. but that s about all i can do. with every passing day i feel less and less drive to smoke and i feel more and more motivated and alert. really cant talk enough about what a great decision this has been for me. after days i plan on starting to drink again, but sparingly. i ve never had too much of an issue with alcohol consumption except when not smoking pot when i would drink very heavily to compensate. i believe i ll be able to keep it just to weekends without any issues. anyways, if anyone has questions, comments or advice, please let me know. much appreciated. stay strong r leaves! we all got this edit slight alterations after reading posting rules",addiction

93.46328,-23.11652,"psa tips for quitting hey guys i just recently found this sub and have been reading a lot of the posts and i think this place is fucking great. i used to smoke daily and realized how much it was fucking my life up but when i tried to quit, there was nobody to help me. everyone just said it is not addictive and that was it. no support groups or anything. i relapsed seven times partly because of this, and mostly because of my lack of willpower. i made my own formula for quitting and thought id share it with you. . get rid of all your bud and paraphernalia obviously . . get rid of anything and i mean anything in your environment that reminds you of it. reduce the chance of triggering cravings. . if your friends are total stoners that either do not respect you quitting or do not do anything with you but smoke, cut them out of your life. you have to. . delete your dealers number s and those of any of the people you cut out in rule . . find something you enjoy doing. the whole reason i smoked at first was because it was a hobby i enjoyed. now that you have cut it out, you need something to fill the void, something to remind you that you can still enjoy life without weed. . meet new people. make friends with others to fully complete the transition. i realize some these seem extreme and daunting but if you have seriously had it, if you have hit rock bottom and known the depression and worthless feeling that comes with it, you have to do it. when you quit, the rest will come. for a while you may feel lonely not being with your old friends but when you find a hobby and rebound from the weed and become more outgoing again, you will make them. there may be some lonely sleepless nights in the beginning but you know it is an addiction, and coming out of an addiction is never easy. once you hit two weeks you are gold. there is a light at the end of the tunnel, do not let the darkness scare you.",addiction

prolly should. realized that the money needed for transition and the likelihood of finding a job as a woman with a five o clock shadow did not mesh, so spent about five years meandering from job to job and home to homelessness. in the process, fell off a roof and royally fucked my back, which was compounded by scoliosis the school docs had never caught and a cyst the size of a fist behind my abdominal wall that i had removed once, and grew back. my best friend, who quite possibly had a life even more fucked up than my own, started smoking trees... all of a sudden, it was like he had come back alive. he did not cry all the time, he actually wanted to do things, he laughed again. i tried it, found the first relief i would had since my back pain started. with my family history, i always opted for deal with it rather than risk opioid dependency. i started working out again, got into the best shape of my life, and came to the realization that living as a freak happy in my own body probably beat hating the coward i saw in the mirror and wanting to kill myself, so i started transitioning anyway. in the meantime, my best friend headed downhill he would sought psychiatric help and they told him that trees were the reason he was depressed, and he needed to stop smoking them and start taking their drugs. he went through a few hospital stays, and cycled through something like medications over the course of three years. he decided to get a fresh start in a new state, and i went with him. my hormones were off the charts remember when puberty hit full swing? yeah, something like that and he was on and off so many meds that his side effects were nearly as bad as his symptoms. we argued, he kicked me out, i let him and cut ties. i built a new life from nothing. again. lost my car, found a partner, talked my way into a retail job and consistently outperformed anyone is expectations. all while smoking. got suicidally depressed earlier this year when i realized there probably was not going to be a time when my life became a normal woman is, and i would probably always wonder if the people laughing when i went out were laughing at me. spent some time in the hospital, quit smoking, started the doc is drugs. ended up smoking after a month anyway, and back to business as usual. two weeks ago, my best friend who had moved back home drove to my state, bought a gun, and blew his head off in a park. went home to find out he would told everyone how ashamed he was of how things ended with us, and how he wished we could reconnect. i was one of his last friends that he pushed away, and to avoid portraying myself as a saint i said my own share of fucking hurtful things when i was feeling hurt myself. since it happened, i alternate between autopilot, sleeping too much, smoking myself out of the reality of the situation, and uncontrollable sobbing screaming. my whole life has been chaos, and the years i knew him was longer than i would had contact with anyone in my life including my own parents. we spent most of that years seeing each other every day. so now i have not smoked for a week, because i am out and i do not have the money for more anyway. i also do not have the money to see my doctor about my med levels, or my shrink about how fucked up i feel. i work hours a week in a retail hell that makes me want to scream, and pay of everything i make into an insurance policy that, with my shitty retail wage, i still ca not afford to use. my back is agony, my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds, and i am still a woman who questions every look people give me. i do not want to overstate my case for the oppression olympics, but the job market does not get any easier when you are an unprotected minority. i still want to kill myself. i am so incredibly scared of following the same path he did, pushing people away and riding the pharmaceutical merry go round til i look for the fastest way out. i also do not like feeling like i am carrying on the proud family tradition of addiction but the haze is the only time i feel beautiful, the only time i feel worthwhile, the only time i stop thinking about why the fuck i should bother long enough to bother and do something. what the fuck do i do?",addiction

9.529572,-52.380985,"how to think about willpower i am in university right now studying as a full time student. i am taking a philosophy class that is about understanding human patterns of thinking. the class focuses on the reasons we think the things we do and gives tips and resources to improve our own thought patterns. pretty cool class. anyways, we were talking about willpower which is the reason i decided to write up this post for you guys. the two main ways willpower is viewed in philosophy is it is a finite and usable resource kind of like an energy bar in a video game . so, writing up a paper may deplete some of your willpower energy. the alternative is that willpower is smart usage of attention. every time we do something, we are using our attention on that task. whether the task is pleasurable or not impacts how likely we are to perform that task. so, if you had to direct your attention to write a paper or you had to direct your attention to play your favorite video game, it is more likely that you would want to play the game. this is because there is less negative feelings associated with that particular activity. the professor starts talking about these two methods of viewing willpower and goes into some studies. it turns out that those who were willpower as a finite resource will perform worse on tasks than those who do not view it as such. additionally, when tasked with many items to complete, those who view willpower as finite will consistently perform worse. i do not have the studies off my memory, but can dig it up if this post gets big enough. this really made me think about the way i view willpower, which i am assuming is the same for my fellow adhders out there. constantly, i tell myself i am too tired, exhausted from the day, to even try to finish up my work. i have started trying to view willpower as smart usage of attention and found improvement. do not get me wrong, this is by no means a solution. the actual process of taking our attention and using it in a way that furthers our goals is almost impossible for many of us. but i have found that simply by changing the way i perceive willpower, i am able to feel better about the tasks that i do complete. i have found that instead of not doing something because i am just so exhausted that i will think about it as just another direction of my attention. it is been helping out with preventing me beating myself up for not doing things and seems to be just a better way to think about willpower so as to finish up all this work i have to do. i just wanted to share this with you guys because i have gotten so much from the community and want to give back a little. try this change in perspective for a few days and let me know what you all think! comment if you would like any clarification or if you have questions for me",adhd
0.52396524,106.643906,"i know i should tell people about my adhd so that they can accommodate me, but i am scared they will take advantage. this is probably going to read like an r relationships post. upon reading it back it is also really negative. it was cathartic to write though, so even if nobody reads it, it felt good to get it all out. the last relationship i had ended because i was cheated on, and my ex constantly gaslighted gaslit? me. they knew i had a crappy memory and would use this to their advantage. i tried writing everything i was suspicious of down, but would lose or misplace the notebooks i would written in. we lived together and shared a room so i never had a place i could go to clear my head. this carried on for a couple of years and i was constantly suspicious but never had any concrete proof, and whenever i voiced my concerns they would tell me that stuff never happened, they had no idea what i was talking about, that my adhd was making me misremember things, and that i was crazy. eventually i did get evidence of them cheating on me, they admitted it, we broke up, got out of the lease, etc. it validated all of my suspicions and i originally felt relieved, because i was not crazy i was being gaslighted! and while that was not good , at least i had not fabricated it. my instincts had been right all along!! but then one of the last things that they said to me was basically that i was awesome when we started dating because i was quirky and attractive and fun, but when we moved in together they got to see all of the annoying parts of adhd the always being late for stuff, the getting distracted easily, the being neurotic, the having to write everything down. basically, it was unattractive and they did not want to deal with dating a mentally disabled person who needs their hand held . that really hurt. people are totally allowed dealbreakers and that is fine, but i had never been secretive about it. it is not like i randomly developed the shitty memory or the time blindness. i have always had it, they knew this. the experience made me really wary about trusting people, both in general and with them knowing that i had adhd. so after we broke up, i ended up making a new group of friends. they were all really nice. i decided to straight up tell them from the beginning hey, i have adhd, i am late and have a crap memory so that if anybody objected, better to know sooner than later right? i figured i would rather get it out of the way before i got emotionally attached and then discovering that it was an issue. thankfully everyone was cool about it, and while me being late for stuff annoyed them sometimes, at least they knew why it was. i think everybody in that group had a thing one guy had dyslexia, another bipolar, etc. so we all tried to be understanding of one another, and it was nice, it really felt like i fitted in. this continued for about a year, we had loads of great times until one of the girls in the group we shall call her kay started lying about stuff. i recognised the pattern from my previous relationship, only instead of lying about cheating, this girl lied about... everything . stuff that made absolutely no sense. stuff like having cereal instead of toast for breakfast. i overlooked that because a who would lie about something as tiny as that and b it did not affect us what she had for breakfast so weird lie, but whatever. but it got to the point where it did start affecting us. we would be trying to plan events and kay would say to me that she had sorted whatever it was that she would been assigned e.g. transport and then the day would come and we would not have bus tickets. i would ask her privately about them and she would say she was never in charge of transport, what was i talking about, why was i asking her, etc. we planned most of our hangouts through messenger we all privately messaged one another about specifics, and had a big group chat where we just shitposted and stuff , so after stuff like this happened a few times i decided to look back through our pms and realised there had been multiple times where kay had written and or confirmed something, then to my face and the group denied all knowledge of it. so i called her out on it. the next time we were hanging out just the two of us, i messaged her with screenshots and calmly asked her why she had lied about it at first she got all panicked and started to cry. said that she did not know why she did it and just wanted for us to think she was cool ??? . i told kay we all liked her, but lying to people is awful and that it was especially confusing for me, as my memory is horrible and she knew this. she apologised profusely, said she felt awful about the whole thing and was going to go home. so she did. a few days later and i would been kicked out of the group chat and unfriended by almost everybody in it. i messaged them all asking what happened and got a very cryptic you know what you did in response. i genuinely had no idea. one of the guys let is call him jake was nice enough to message me properly, he said that after kay had gone home that night, she messaged everyone else privately accusing me of cornering her, yelling at her that she was a liar, and threatening to beat her up ?!?! . apparently i had made a scene and she was now scared of me, and that she had not lied, but my adhd had probably made me misremember everything, and that i was a horrible person and could we all please ban me from the friendship group because i am a bully. of course i had screenshots that proved the opposite, but could not show them as everyone then blocked me on messenger. so now everyone just thinks i am an arsehole. jake saw right through this as he had had similar experiences with her before, and his brother has adhd so he has had personal experience with it and knows that you do not just randomly fabricate entire conversations. the next time i saw kay on her own, i called her out on her shit. and what she said was that i probably would not be too affected by my leaving the group, because i would probably just forget they all existed by tomorrow anyway, just like i did everything else, so what was the problem? that also really fucking hurt. that was just straight up malicious . i did not sign up to have a shitty memory. jake and i still hang out and he is really cool, so i guess one good thing came out of the whole situation. but whenever i see anyone from that group on the street i just feel shitty and let down, and angry at myself because if i could only fucking remember things then i would not be easily lied to. i got a job in a shop recently. i bought a notebook and write down everything as i go along so i can reference it later if i forget how to do something. my manager is a stoic person and gets agitated quite easily. i wrote that i had adhd on my medical form but it was never brought up. i am scared in case i tell him hey, i have adhd, please can i get extra help with doing certain things because once i forgot to write something in my book, went to him to ask him to please repeat it and he said you should have remembered the first time, i am not here to hold your hand for you which is similar to what my ex said . so now i feel like a fucking idiot and i am scared to ask for help because it is true, why would they hire somebody to do a job who sucks at remembering how to do it? there is been a few times where i have randomly left stuff in places it should not have been, i have accidently given customers too much change, i have left the tap running, etc. i am just waiting for the day something serious happens that genuinely is not my fault but due to my track record of being a fucking liability, getting the blame for it. i am getting better but i know i will never have a normal memory. i kind of do need my hand held. tl dr i have zero memory. it is been taken advantage of in the past. now i have a job and i am scared to tell my manager because if anything goes wrong i will inevitably get the blame for it.",adhd

13.988172,-6.4277873,"not drinking and business travel my work over the past years has involved a lot of travel, most of it intercontinental. and for the majority of that time i have used alcohol extensively while traveling. i recently stopped drinking but kept traveling. here is what i ve learned as it relates to work travel for me. . learning how to not drink while on a business trip has been like learning how to not drink all over again, and is challenging in ways i didn t expect. over the years i have been on the road, virtually every aspect of my travel has been obsessively refined into a highly optimized routine, from how i pack, to the fastest path through every airport, to where i sit in the lounge, to the best seat on each type of plane, etc. what i did not realize was that this effort to build routines and consequently make the process easier has also left many scripts in my mind which involved drinking. scripts such as get through security, go to my favorite place, order eggs benedict and a bloody mary. another bloody mary and the check. then get to the lounge, get a glass of white wine and call the office , etc. the result is that i have been continuously surprised to find that my autopilot was telling me to get a drink, even when i did not particularly desire one. clearly i have to break and rebuild each of these scripts, one by one. . boredom is a big issue. it just is. doing a long haul plane journey sober is boring. evenings in hotel rooms alone are incredibly boring and somewhat depressing. and ok, this is going to make me sound like a bad person but dinners with colleagues can be incredibly boring too. clearly a lot of my alcohol consumption was to offset the tedium, the time alone and the forced conversation. . i have found that a helpful strategy for the boredom is to permit myself some alternative semi addictive vices i have taken up playing chess online and strategy based video games. also arranging commitments for during the evening is a great help if the timezone allows, a facetime call with the family is the perfect. . it is rude to play strategy based video games when out to dinner with work colleagues. but it turns out this one is effortlessly better without drink. i just pick a time on the early side when i am going to make an exit, have pleasant enough conversation until then and go. at least half the time they call it a night then as well even if there are a bunch of them because of course it turns out they did not want to be out exhausting themselves with late nights and booze either, they just did not want to go first. . medicating myself to help sleep on planes is more important since i can t rely on drink to knock me out. some combination of melatonin and ambien or diphenhydramine works best for me but obviously take a physician is advice not mine. i try to calibrate this pretty carefully to avoid a hangover. if i got a hangover without even drinking i would probably twist that into a justification that i may as well drink. but having some sleep medication with me ensures that there is never the temptation to justify alcohol for its medicinal value. . not drinking is not a panacea. i still suffer the dip in mood that for me comes hand in hand with jet lag. sometimes things suck for reasons other than drinking too much, which frankly is a bit of a revelation since so many things had felt so much better so quickly since i stopped drinking too much. . i have discovered that the way i drink while traveling is based on some outdated or immature beliefs that probably seemed reasonable to a younger me at some point. . outdated belief number it is part of a constellation of perks that show how important i am. i think a lot of business travel flatters my ego. i ve been doing it long enough that i generally travel at the front of the plane and get a lot of status related fake love and benefits. i used to drink more just because it gave me a kick to go to whatever lounge and have someone offer me cocktails or champagne. i ca not be bothered trying to fix my fragile ego i have just ju jitsued myself into believing that the ultimate sign of status is not needing the perks. . outdated belief i am on expenses so i should make use of them. i mean, except for the fact that the free stuff is ruining my life this reasoning is completely fine. . unfortunately i just like hotel bars in big cities. i ve frankly never really had a good conversation with a bartender at one and i ve certainly never hooked up with an improbably glamorous and yet somehow available fellow traveler sitting at the next bar stool, but it is all pretty seductive in a kind of cinematic way. i don t really feel equal to not drinking in that situation so just figured it is best to avoid them. all that said, the most striking thing is how much better shape i can be in when i return home by avoiding alcohol, even if doing so comes with a few additional challenges. i used to more or less spend the weekend half comatose when i returned from a week in asia, while my kids climbed all over me and my wife made understanding noises because of how exhausting the jet lag must be. i am not proud to admit that the majority of that impact was from the booze, since it feels like i have spent many years deceiving her and others. but i am glad to be able to come home and show up.",alcoholism

-100.673065,8.228519,first time in years. days completed! i have not went days since the first time i tasted alcohol. i was a late bloomer. i grew up in a household where i was taught to be scared of alcohol. i feared it and never wanted to try it. i was always told there was alcoholism in my blood. i did not want to take that one drink and immediatly loose all my inhibitions and take my pants off and run down the road like a crazy person. did much more embarrassing things later though so i was and months been around more people that drank and they generally kept there pants on so i got curious. first time i tried it i drank beers in a little over an hour and never looked back. i was drinking a pack each night of the weekend within months and drinking most days throughout the workweek. it was time to party anytime and it was great. all that i heard about alcohol was false. this shit was great! i could even talk to girls for the first time in my life. why would they deceive me like that! i think that thinking led me too ignore all warning signs and just live to drink. i will turn this week on thanksgiving. i do not really remember all that much fun from the last years. i remember bits and peices. i got married had two kids and i have to look to my wife for almost all the memories. i sure hope quiting drinking helps some of those memories to come back. i do not want to dwell on the past too much on a day that i am super proud of myself. i am going to skip the middle and just say before i quit last week my intake had slowly grown to three and a half to four packs a week. plus dinners out and occasional bars and for at least the last to years probably more i drank everyday except maybe a handful of times i was too sick to get outta bed. i guess i just needed to write out a little back story. i am loving clear headed mornings and my fog is getting less and less. the world is full of so much more color and richness than i have seen in a long time. i love it! one hard thing right now is my wife met me as a drinker. she has never had a problem with it. i never had to hide it from her. i learned to control just enough to not fuck shit up too bad. so far but it was getting much harder for me last saturday for the first time after well over beers i remember vaguely telling her i wanted to quit. ive had it in the back of my mind for a long time now just thought if i quit i would die from extreme withdraws. i would never tell her i wanted to quit because i did not want her to start wanting me to quit. it was quick and it was done and i think she may have just thought it was drunk talk. last night after i got home from work she saw that i still was not drinking and finally asked. are you planning on quiting forever? i said i ca not think about that but im not drinking today. she asked why. it took me a minute to come up with an answer. like i said earlier i never talked to her about it because i do not want her to want me too. or think i am weak maybe not the man she thought i was. we talked for a little bit. just hard for me to talk to long at this point. i think she understands but i feel like i just threw this on her. now she feels guilty to drink her one drink in front of me. and this makes me feel horrible. like i am screwing her and my friends fun all up! i have only talked to my daily drinking buddy from across the street one time he had big beer in hand. i did not and it was weird. i know it will be fine i just need to talk to her more about what is going on. she is amazing and put up with so much over the years. well this ended up being alot more rambling than i planned. maybe i just needed to write some stuff out. i am excited for my next week of today is. i want to work on living life sober and not just a dry drunk. saw that in a few posts this week. this sub is awesome and has helped me immensely this week! have a great day!,alcoholism

1.0652804,101.31016,"there is something wrong with me and i would like to talk to people who get it hi guys, i think i have anxiety and it has been worrying me lately esp. the past few months. i have been talking about it on various subreddits besides this one so i would just like to club all my experiences so someone call tell me what the hell is wrong with me. it is a long description so thank you whoever tries to read this. first of all, i am a very hyper aware and also a negative person, i like to be aware of all the contingencies and back up plans. i like to worry about things beforehand so i am always prepared to tackle situations when something goes awry. people call me a pessimist, cynical and overall a negative person. though never in my life have i considered myself an anti social person. anyway, the past few months i used to smoke weed at least once a week. i liked the part where i would get munchies, and music sounded real good. but i started noticing that i get self conscious around people, my thought process becomes complicated, it is hard to elaborate your train of thought to people, especially people you are not very comfortable with i.e. people who are not your good friends . one day at home i got really high, and i noticed i started associating shapes with objects and words. it was overall a strange experience. for example i looked in the mirror and suddenly got reminded of the number maybe my head looked like that number? . i also heard sounds similar to hypnagogic hallucinations random sounds you hear when you are just about to fall asleep the sounds were not talking to me, some were not even human sounds, just random clicks and buzzes. i guess i heard my mom is voice as well. i could not cipher anything though. and i do not hear these sounds when i am sober. anyhoo, one more thing that used to happen when i was really high was that i saw this particular shape. it was a strange shape, but i could see it everywhere. for example, if i concentrated on the street ahead of me, i somehow saw the shape somewhere, like there was a semblance of the shape in a pattern on the road, or streetlights somehow resembled that particular shape. again, nothing really changed you know, i just saw things the way they were, when i concentrated i saw that shape somewhere in my field of vision. also, i do not see this shape when i am not high. i know what you must be thinking, weed is not for me. or i need to find a different strain. well i quit weed cold turkey so that is done and dusted. however what has definitely stayed with me even though i quit weed around six weeks ago is that i sometimes get feelings of derealisation, that everything around me is foggy and most of the time i find myself asking is this really happening the feeling is less intense now, but should not it have gone away, considering it is been six weeks? what is wrong with me? i obviously obsess over things, maybe you are noticing in the way i describe things. a really bad habit of mine is googling things and worrying about things even though i know that i am exaggerating my symptoms to qualify for a particular disorder. past few days i developed a deep fear of getting schizophrenia. i looked at the symptoms, a few matched, a lot did not match at all. but i was still freaking out because i am and that is all what i needed to freak out about it. one of the major signs of schizophrenia is that people who get it are usually not aware of the symptoms that they are showing. i took a schizophrenia quiz and i got a bloody zero! but still i have this fear somehow, it has placated but it is still there, since i am an idiot. i also have developed this chronic jamais vu when it comes to my cognitive process. like we remember a few things and we picture them in our mind, right? i somehow thought that it was a strange thing and other people do not do it so i have some form of mental disease. i asked my sister if she can picture some random bullshit when she closes her eyes. she said yes, that is what having a brain is like. your brain visualises random things, and not everything tthat comes in your mind has to make sense . i guess it is true but sometimes it scares me you know, like i am waiting for the train and a memory randomly pops up in my brain and i obsess over the reason why it came into my mind? was i always like this? depersonalisation i have been able to control to a greater extent i guess, i am sometimes able to shake the feeling off. but i still have some scary realisations for e.g. i came to class one day and when i sat on my desk this thought came into my mind like did i really commute one hour to reach college and now i am in class? wow this is the reason why i have been loving socialising lately. because i do not dwell with these intrusive thoughts as much as i do when i am alone. i llike the idea of sleeping because my anxiety is at bay but hate waking up because of the fear of return of these thoughts. grrr. another thing i have been obsessing over is the voices that i hear sometimes that my paranoid ass thinks my brain made because i am gonna get schizophrenia. i was sitting in my class one day, facing away from the door and i heard my professor say something, i turned and my professor was not there. similarly one day i was on an escalator and i heard a girl say excuse me and i moved, there was no girl behind me. only men. both these incidents have forced me to overthink. i hear voices and ask people around me if they heard it. everytime they said they had.. what is wrong with me, i think it is both depression and anxiety. could it be more? could it be an early sign or bipolar or psychosis? tell me what you think guys p.s please do not just say see a doctor also thank you so much for reading such a long post. you are awesome!",anxiety

ish years. i am currently , and this is a quick timeline of what is been going on age , started experiencing general anxiety for no apparent reason. also, felt stressed a lot for no real reason either. doctor thought it might be anxiety depression so suggested i see a therapist and try some antidepressants. i tried a couple antidepressants and saw a therapist with no success. antidepressants did absolutely nothing, and therapist was at a loss as to how to help. this generalized anxiety worry stress feeling continued. age , while still dealing with the above, i woke up one day after a good night is sleep and felt a little tired. i attributed it to anxiety or stress from school, but it never went away. but it was very mild, so i just let it go and tried making lifestyle changes with no success. over the months and years, it has very gradually worsened to the point where i am at now where i can hardly function due to the overwhelming fatigue brain fog. it is . not even a second of feeling better. age present have had nearly every sort of medical testing one can have done, many of them multiple times. food allergy, vitamin mineral deficiencies, thyroid, cortisol, testosterone, heavy metals, mri, eeg, ekg, lyme disease, epstein barr, h pylori, sleep apnea, dietary changes, sleep schedule changes, increase exercise, etc. have tried a total of different antidepressants anxieties from different drug classes to see if maybe depression was the culprit. all either did nothing or made me more tired foggy. i ve tried vyvanse, adderall, ritalin, kratom, cbd, kava, and countless other supplements. the stimulants all either helped very slightly, but felt very artificial and made my body more anxious but didn t help my mind, or didn t do anything. caffeine in any form doesn t help either. i ve seen different psychologists, all of whom were baffled and said they did not know how to help me and have never heard of this before relative to mental health issues. i feel this intense dissociation feeling that has gradually emerged worsened over the past couple of years. like i am so tired, i do not even feel like i am in real life ever anymore. i feel drunk drugged, especially as the day progresses. come pm, i feel so spaced out, the fatigue is unbearable. sometimes, i feel so tired i feel physically ill. the gradual cognitive decline is shocking concentration, alertness, memory, focus, processing recalling stumbling over words and sentences, confusion, etc. . my motor skills have also declined badly as well. i bump into things, my reflexes are awful, i miss things when i try and grab them, etc. i feel dizzy lightheaded when i stand up after sitting or laying down. i now have very low arousal. it is almost impossible to startle me. it is like my body does not even process loud noises or scare anymore. i feel anxious stressed overwhelmed more easily. everything feels like a chore, like an ordeal i get to check off. even if it is something extremely minor or something fun. decision making is poor, even for relatively minor things. hypersomnia usually fall asleep very easily, rarely have insomnia . vision has declined eye floaters, spots, light sensitivity . eyes are dry watery off and on. numbness all over body. tough to explain, but extremities body parts feel so utterly exhausted and numb like to the touch. like i can feel my arm getting touched by my hand, but can t feel my hand touching my arm. senses feel dulled hearing, taste, smell, touch all feel weakened and suppressed, especially as the day goes on and i feel more tired. sex drive is virtually non existent. alcohol hits me much harder now. as a result, i feel intoxicated more easily quickly. sometimes beer and i am already feeling really drunk. i m slow now both mentally and physically. head almost always feels very tired and heavy, but i do not get headaches that often. i yawn way too much. anhedonia and apathy as i ve gotten tireder and tireder. i have gradually become indifferent to most things. i literally come across like an emotionless zombie now because i am so damn exhausted . almost nothing phases or interests me anymore. i feel like i get every cold flu virus that comes around. and it takes me much longer to get over them. i am emotionally flat lined. one of my eyelids droops a little bit, mostly later in the day and or when i m more tired. i feel like i need lots of sleep to recover , but all sleep really does is reset me a little bit and is very unrefreshing. all of these symptoms seem to be worse when i m sick, stressed, get less sleep, etc. overall, it feels like i was hit by a truck. from the moment i wake up to the moment i pass out from sheer exhaustion at night. everything feels like it is suppressed by this fog that has gradually gotten worse over time. for example, caffeine s effect, sex drive, post workout adrenaline and endorphins, getting plenty of sleep, etc. i can sort of feel all these things for the most part, but it feels hidden and pushed down from this utter exhaustion. it s like nothing can surpass the fatigue and fog. it is gotten to the point where i feel like i am living my life from the backseat and am just going through the day mindlessly on autopilot. it literally gives me anxiety and depression to feel like this and not know why, and watch my life just pass me by at the same time. and the thing that sucks is that i want to do things and live life, and am still pretty optimistic, but i am just too out of it, it is embarrassing. i come across like a drugged zombie when i try. x b realistically, the last kind of test i can do at this point is a sleep study, which is in a few weeks. in a way, sadly, i hope they find something. any advice is greatly appreciated.",anxiety

still the same. this year i hear about one of my bullies stole from the store with one of my friends. they were caught by my father. i was not really thinking about my friend so much as my bully a . and i told two people about the situation. i told them not to say anything to anyone else and one of them did. and it got out. i felt absolutely terrible, i thought i was just as bad as the people who bullied me all those years ago and as of th. she previous friend yelled at me over text which i deserved. i told her i was going to fix it and own up to my mistakes, and i told her how sorry i was. i did not want this to happen at all. so i tried, and someone did something that i still do not know what which caused her to snap at me again. she tried to sue me and my father. but nothing could be done cause there was no proof. she stopped coming to school. it should also be noted that ranted to my friend saying that i wish i was dead, she told a counselor and i was then stuck in a psych ward for hours. i started not leaving the house, but only to go to school. i would do this for the rest of the year and through th. x b th comes and she comes back. which i was happy about cause this meant she was better. but she continuously talked about me behind my back and glared at me in the hall. she was not in any of my classes but i still felt enormous guilt. she would talk to her friends and they would point and laugh at me. this one time i walked past her and her group of friends and she just said ew. over and over again as she passed me. i never once said anything to her the entire year. x b th comes around senior year and she is still not in my classes. she is here for maybe the first two three months and then never comes back. i am doing better with her gone, as sad that is to say. moved out of our old gross apartment into a new one, started therapy. i went to a school dance. our equivalent of prom is ball. i started going out into public. i was still bullied however, i was one of the poor kids. i got a bag of food from the school every week or so just to help out around the house. these very rich kids, two of which bullied me back in th and th always brought up how it smelled gross near me. called my food bag my rations and scared me whenever possible. called me chicken, and a loser. i am afraid of blood, birds, violence, open water, loud noises, the dark, large dogs, vomit, sharp objects and needles. they would make puking noises near me i absolutely hate the noise . made fun of how i never talked to them i had such bad anxiety i could not . they would turn in their seats to stare at me and make weird noises to make me uncomfortable and scare me. i also had gym with them, they were not as bad though. x b sorry for such a long post. so here is the question how did you guys get over things like this?

, no, he likes you but the party gets a little crazy, there is over people going in his small apartment... did you wanna go? i do not want to just insert myself well if you want to go, you can be my plus one. . he said he wanted me to go but i really should have just let it be. i regret that. last night, i spent so long getting ready. i did vampire makeup, had a costume, my boyfriend was a werewolf, we looked great and both spent hours getting ourselves presentable. i loved our costumes. but when i had just shown up to the party and immediately knew i was out of place. i saw so many people i did not know, i had seen my boyfriend pass exchanges to strangers, dumbfounded as to how the fuck anyone could just say something without wanting to shrivel up and die. people talking loudly, ready to drink, it was just barely setting up. two of his friends arrived and i awkwardly said hi asked how they were, and from there i have absolutely nothing to say, sometimes, i have no idea how people even make it one sentence further. i told him i had to go home and i felt terrible. he had warned me there was going to be a ton of people that might make me anxious and i did not listen. i wanted to test myself and, to me, i had failed miserably. he was gentle and loving as always, and i told him i was scared to leave because i did not wanna be looked at. so he escorted me down to the elevator. i could not look at him, i could barely talk to him, i was so full of shame. everyone did this, i saw people in there doing this. in the building i heard dozens of rowdy people my age going to their floors for their halloween parties, yelling, having fun. i feared being seen by them and kept looking around to spot them. i had been honked at and yelled at probably all in good fun earlier in the night as i was wearing a cape, but that put me on edge, i just did not want any comments. i wanted to disappear. i told my boyfriend i was sorry over and over. he felt sorry that he invited me, but not in a mean way, in a i should have done more to warn you way. he knew how bad i felt, and i was kind of cold but not because i was angry at him, i was mad at myself and just wanted to escape and feared someone coming down the hall seeing me crying or something. i kissed him but did not really touch him, and when he would make a gesture like caress my face, i would gently move away, and he made a face that hurt my heart so bad. i just did not want attention on us, like i was a big fucking baby already and wanted no one to see me i did not want to be looked at as a crying idiot in a vampire costume. i felt so bad i love him so much, i said i am sorry and that i love him he said to tell him when i got home, and i left after kissing him quickly. when i was on the way to the car there were so many people getting excited over their parties in the parking lot, one group passed me and went ah! sarcastically at my costume and i hated that. i took the stairwell upon hearing the elevator coming down with yelling people, and got in my car shortly after. in tears, i ripped off my teeth and fake nails, and his friend suddenly walked up and tapped on my door and scared me in a mask. i said hi and he said come on let is go! assuming i would just arrived. i told him i was leaving, looking down because i was tearing up and did not want him to notice. already? yeah, have fun though! he could tell i am sure that i was upset, and he was like have a good night, drive safe, seeya buddy! i knew i had to leave now, and i scream cried all the way home. i fell asleep in my makeup, did not brush the taco bell i ate off my teeth, and left the light on, miserable. i am going to work with fake blood stains on my mouth in a bit. but i wanted to share. i just want to know i am not the only one. a lot of my friends are mentally ill, and have an anxiety disorder, but none really like mine it seems. i just feel like my case is more outwardly extreme. crying, panicking at nothing, going absolutely silent when i start feeling anxious mid conversation, i do not see them doing that. and... i want to be wanted, i want to be invited, i do not want them to stop inviting me out. and my boyfriend and i texted briefly when i got home, all warm and comforting, but the last text he sent me was just i love you too and i do not know... i am scared i hurt him. am i fighting something that is just in my nature?",anxiety

-111.40181,-41.89189,"ca not stop worrying help! tl dr was abused as a child, now i have crippling social phobia, anxiety, and depression. some background i am a year old guy. my dad is a sociopath. i am not going to go into detail about what makes me think that in this post i was brought up in a very strict christian family. me and my siblings were all homeschooled until college. i was never allowed to do anything my father thought was even remotely immoral . that meant he was in control of who i hung out with, what i watched, what i listened to, what i thought. if he found out me or my siblings did anything wrong, he would lose his shit. he would yell, spank us, take away our favorite things. i was barely even allowed to talk to girls, let alone date them. all of this created a very hostile home. everyone was always trying their hardest to make sure my father did not catch them doing something wrong. he was very controlling over what my mother did. did not let her wear anything that could be considered revealing , never listened to her opinions on anything. would always get his way in any situation within the family. his way of keeping watch over what any of his children did was to encourage us to tattle on each other for everything. it got to the point where me and my siblings would blackmail each other into doing things so they would not tell our dad something they did. this created a division between us that continues to exist. all of this negativity within my household caused me to hide away in my room all day. this abuse from my father eventually lessened a bit when i was about or . my siblings were eventually able to rebuild their relationships, while i was still refusing to interact with anyone. when i was about i finally admitted to my mom that i was depressed and anxious. we decided that i should go to a therapist and try to work it out with him. he diagnosed me with social phobia and depression. this seemed to help for awhile, but my anxiety depression continued to persist. i eventually started visiting a psychiatrist who prescribed me zoloft. this helped for awhile as well, but does not seem to be working anymore. background the past month or two have possibly been the toughest of my life. i realized that i had been completely oblivious willfully ignorant of the continuous abuse within my family. i thought everything that happened within my family was normal, and that me being upset about it was me being a pussy. it was not until a month or two ago that i finally came to terms with the fact that i was actually abused and only with the help of w d . since then i have slowly began to unravel the lies i have been telling myself my whole life to keep me from falling apart. the recognition of the constant worrying and self hatred imposed onto me by my father has been the biggest realization for me. unfortunately, this anxiety and depression continues to weight down on me. i still confine myself to my room in an effort to avoid the discomfort of being near my family. i am still deathly afraid of my father, even though i know he ca not harm me. the hatred he taught me to feel towards people with different opinions still burns strong, although not as intensely as in the past. i think this abuse caused me to reject any sort of love from anyone. my whole life whenever anyone has shown me any kind of platonic or romantic love towards me, i immediately shut them down. i feel like i cannot trust anyone. i truly feel that i have never felt any sort of platonic or romantic love. i still feel so much anxiety interacting with anyone, and especially those who show interest in me. w d has been the one thing that helped me realize all of this. as you can imagine, however, my family is deeply opposed to this. the fear of them catching me is slowly killing me. i ca not enjoy smoking anymore because of how scared i am of them finding out. my mother caught me once and she lost her shit. she threatened to kick me out, told me she done with me treating everyone in the family like shit . that felt good . i do not know what to do anymore. the anxiety seems unbeatable. all i do anymore other than work and school is sit in my rooms and play video games. would love to hear other people thoughts on this. thanks for reading",anxiety

0.48882332,107.00691,"restoring clarity first off, just wanna warn you this post is long af so bear with me. any straight up advice would be appreciated. just for a little background, i am m and have recently dropped out of university after only months because i realised i made a rushed decision in picking it. since then i have almost demonised the thought of going to university even if it were for another course. of course this has left me with a year out which in many ways can be refreshing and useful in picking up on experiences for work and sociability. yet at the moment i am constantly paralysed by thoughts that even getting out of bed is a challenge. i am awaiting checks for any conditions relating to anxiety and depression. i have been going through depersonalisation which is very scary to me. the feeling of waking up not knowing the world as it is, feeling like a spectator to your physical self. i have been able to find a hunger for success in my life but at the moment this is blotted out by the sense that nothing feels real and lacking connection to the outside world. my social anxiety has become very intense recently but i ve always had a desire to be sociable and open to others because i ve always wanted to have plenty of friends. i have been able to control it for months at a time but it doesn t help now that it s become worse again. distancing behaviour is also present which worries me because i have close friendships which are hard to take interest in when you feel empty as fuck. one of my best friends is at a local uni but i see him from time to time as he lives a minute away from me even this feels isolating because i m too overwhelmed by my thoughts. feels like i m sinking in wet sand while i m watching everyone walk on. really kills me. strangely i have lost all interest in activities which is quite offputting when it comes into mind, but that doesn t stop me from doing them. i have started to gym times a week and do badminton every monday night even then i feel like i m sleepwalking through everything and nothing is actually happening. playing pool calms me down too, i d love to take on a sport competitively to keep me occupied. admittedly i spend too much time on technology. for years i have spent my free time alternating between education and just gaming and mindlessly scrolling through the internet something which i feel is a stigma for why i feel so empty especially at this point in life. i have not had any family issues in life unless sibling rivalry at a young age counts . i have never experiences relationships, although i have been involved in situations with girls a few times. at the moment i would still be able to show interest in girls but never really feel a sort of connection beyond that as with anyone really. i feel like my mental problems have blocked off the idea of pleasure including relationships as i m too overwhelmed with my thoughts of finding a purpose. socially i have been quite disconnected and very weirdly it feels like it s ireelevant to me. this i would put down to depression because there have been plenty of times where i ve felt an urge to socialise and i had no problem meeting new people at college. i go out clubbing from time to time but i always end up zoning out into my own world of pain, i can never connect myself to the present. despite this people say i m mature and can speak very fluently despite not feeling like this is the case. also, simple concepts such as friendship feel non existent to me one of the consequences of the forgetfulness i live through. best way to describe my anxiety is its almost like i ve been reborn in every way and have no idea how to live. and that really scares me. as of now, the best way to describe myself is i feel alienated and lost. the world appears a completely foreign place to me and i fear a lot about the future i ve come to an assumption this is one of the other reasons for me feeling depressed . i have low self esteem and have been beating myself down about everything recently. i find it hard to process information which is tiring, but against all odds i did manage to pass my driving test in august first time. a lot of days i feel very lonely yet i can t help but isolate. as hard as it is to see the way forward amongst the fogginess that is my brain atm i have always maintained a strong interest in creative media and would like to start seeing sense in life in the present so i can live with clarity and happiness again rather than dreading on autopilot mode. i am living at home with my parents and my sister, depression makes me overlook the appreciation i should feel having a roof above my head yet i still beat myself up because i feel like i should be experiencing life like a uni student should be at this age. maybe it s just a matter of loneliness rather than having to party every weekend at , it s such a small thing when you think about it yet i feel suicidal when i realise i m spending more time dwelling on the lives of others my age than trying to sort mine out... pls tell me that s absolute irrational. recently i have been lapsing in and out of intense anxiety and this relates to worries of not being able to create a good future and ending up underachieving. basically one thought resulting in another thought times this by or . i want to seek help but everything has become so distorted that i sometimes question whether my life is worth living does this mean decluttering before pursuing my career? i feel bad about myself and the fact that i don t have a thicker skin but when you re in such a state it s so difficult to think logically even if starting off. i never want to disappoint my parents but hope is so thin when you go each day with a constant internal pain that not even close ones can understand. i just feel like a living zombie and my thoughts always tell me i ll never be able to climb out of the hole. in short, depersonalisation, anxiety, possibly depression, hopelessness, lack of motivation is drowning out my desire to go and achieve and i m not sure how to cope . as of now i go one day feeling ok and actually find motivation to do small tasks, the next i could feel suicidal and end up sitting in all day isolating myself i really hate this and doesn t define me at all. what makes me think i m going insane is when someone speaks to me my disassociative state becomes emphasised and once again this creates a new spiral of thoughts. my friend told me i m just overthinking which makes sense in some ways but i still feel suicidal some days. i hope to go travelling around europe and apply for an apprenticeship next year maybe with the bbc , i would love to start a youtube channel as this involves techniques i learnt at college, also i would love to continue on with media whether it s television production or editing. but for now my goal is to rediscover my well being and see life in a positive perspective so i can wake up one day actually knowing who i am physically, spiritually, and identity wise. i m here on this earth in my own body. small steps, but each one to better myself in some way. i want to break away from the spiral of living in fear and worry over every small action i make. at the moment i am in fear of the world and myself for reasons which i can not pinpoint but i want to reach a stage where i can lift myself out of the hole and keep rising. sorry for the long ass post, i d be surprised if you ve made it this far even as i m typing this now my mental state can t even acknowledge what reddit is. so bad i know. like i m trapped in a hench ass bubble around my mind. if you have any advice or questions please let it out if you need anyone to speak to about interests or whatever your mind can think of, don t be afraid to drop me a message... stay positive in short i m going through anxiety and depression which has got me in a state of irrational overthinking and feeling constant fear. i still feel a drive to succeed in life but also being dragged into a spiral of depression no matter how hard i try. dp dr making me feel super paranoid about everything. always have a desire to get back on

39.4013,-59.087585,"vicious cycles anger, bitterness, guilt, remorse so i am and quite dissatisfied with my life right now, though i think that is redundant in this sub reddit. my mood is increasingly volatile. my bouts of anger are increasing in frequency. my vision of the future is clouded. i live a repeated cycle of anger, guilt, then despair. so i am not going to say my life is god awful, because it is not. obviously there are billions of people with worse situations than mine, which the fact that i can still bitch about my life just adds to the guilt i feel. but at least i do not bitch about my life to people i know, just to strangers job so i work a blue collar job, despite having a bachelors degree, because it is a family company that i hope to run one day. there are three problems with this plan i kind of hate my job now. i have been driven to throw up several days during the summer, and even when i do not, i feel like i might almost every day. in my experience, there are not many jobs that ask you to be physically ill almost every day, so i take exception to this. i think i will really hate my dads job. no, it is not physically demanding, but i see the crap he puts up with and the insane stress he is under constantly and it terrifies me. the company is not even profitable right now. when i joined on, it was in hopes that the company will be profitable as it was in the past, but for now it is just blind faith. so you may ask, if you are dissatisfied, why do not you look for another job? reasonable question. answer i think it would crush my dad, even if he did not say so. this was a dynamic i did not consider before joining the company. i feel like i just cannot leave him, it would kill his motivation. even this is a double edged sword though. sometimes i worry that by me staying, he is put under more stress to make it succeed. my friends. what is there to say, every year there are fewer and fewer. in addition, we all have less free time to see each other. everybody is moving on with life. i enjoy my time with them when i do see them, but hanging out does not have the same serendipity that it did when i was younger. home life. i basically hate it. i live with my mom in a house we can ill afford. there is something viscerally unattractive about living with your mother when you are . my disappointment in where my life is leads me to be short with her, which again leads to guilt followed by despair. i moved out when i was in college, so it is not like i have never left home, but i kind of regret coming back. this begs the question if you are dissatisfied living at home, why do not you move out? great question. answer because i ca not leave my mom here alone. that is not even close to feasible. not only is it a daunting idea to leave an old lady alone in a house, but she is also a hardcore alcoholic so the chance of her injuring herself is legitimate. so until someone else moves in with her, i am stuck. also, though i could afford to move out, i feel it is better for me to save money. not everyone has the option to live at home, so i would feel kind of selfish to move out. relationships i was in a serious relationship since that formally ended in , but did not completely end until a few months ago. i have been a bit devastated since, really. there is no other way around it. i was not at the point of dysfunction i did not have the option not to function. but it brought a lot of pain that i largely had to just keep to myself. she broke up with me through a text saying that she had started seeing someone else. there is just something piercing about giving a relationship your all, and it ending that way. god forbid she be alone for one minute in between relationships. back to the solodolo life for me. i just do not have a dating personality. it is going to be a while for me, i know. i have high standards for a partner much higher standards than i have any business asking for lol , i am not sociable, i am not particularly fun or interesting. basically my plan is just to improve myself as much as possible physically, financially, mentally to make myself more attractive in a true sense of the word. i do this because i know me i am not just going to go find someone else, i need a plan. so my problems in a nutshell? a genetic predisposition to anxiety, deep rooted feelings of inadequacy every relationship i have been in has been ended by the other person , and feelings of helplessness stuck at home and at job , and feelings of futility what has been the point of anything i have done in life? at least i have it all on paper, this has served as sort of a mind map for my frustration thanks for reading. i would gladly return the favor for anyone who wants to talk about anything.",depression

that would be the last time i would talk to him. roughly hours later, i awoke with a start. not the groggy, gradual way you normally wake up. i had a few missed calls from my dad is friend, but thought nothing of it. assumed they were just calling to see if i was going. my work called me to see if i was okay, and found out people my uncle and his gf were frantically looking for me. i called my dad is friend, assuming maybe my dad fell and was being taken to the hospital. after minute on the phone, i fell to the floor, and feel like i have been there since. my dad had died. he fell and hit his head on concrete. we do not know and will never know if he had a stroke, a heart attack, or what that caused it. i immediately called my brother, who drove with his family over night. i did not sleep but maybe hours on wednesday, and it feels like i have been in a blur and numb to the world since. in less than years, i have loss both of my parents. my dad the worse. we looked out for each other, and talked about doing things together. i casually mentioned i wanted to travel to europe and take a train ride tour. i found out thursday he really wanted to do it too. we would discussed doing things this weekend around the house, as i was off for the weekend. my brother was bringing his family on the th of july, and we talked about him going on a small trip with them to spend time with his grandchildren. but none of that will happen. and it is tearing me apart. for the record, i have had thoughts of suicide. but, i have always said to myself you are bigger than that. you are not a coward. that is taking the easy way out. and it is kept me alive this long, and i do not see a scenario where i would allow it to get beyond brief moments of weakness. i have seen countless outpouring of support from friends and family through facebook and over the phone, texts, and some in person. so, it is helped, somewhat. but, it still feels like nothing will pull me out of it this time. i do not have any motivation to fight, and just want to slip into this hole into obscurity. i do not want to be alone, but do not know what i do to not be that way. i mean is this all me dealing with the loss of my dad, so suddenly? one minute i am okay, next i am in a daze, then i am balling my eyes out. i just do not know what to do. i am just going through the motions.",depression

0.2906917,108.95453,"how a visual novel changed my way of seeing life. long by some random internet guy. yo, you who read this and who probably has enough time to do this. because hey. you are on the internet. and you have time. yeah you do. read it entirely. my feelings are scattered throughout the text because it is easier for me to explain like that. anyway, let is get the situation up. i am a years old male from western europe. i do not go to college but take some classes that interest me once per week. nothing more. hours of classes per week, and that feels enough for me. at the moment at least. i am a big gamer, playing dota pretty much fulltime, trying to get good, because hey who knows one day i will be an awesome player and get money from it. i do not have a passion next to that. or well, sometimes something pops up in my head... like hey, that is interesting, i should make my life out of it . and then hours later is gone. what was i even thinking? . sometimes i like to think that i am just a bit late on my puberty and am too young in my head to make a choice. i did one semester of computer science before getting bored of it. i get bored of things pretty quick, you gotta know. so i stopped going. computer all day, whoo... what to ask more? man, on a pc i get more fun, more knowledge and more social contact than i do all day at college. surfing the internet, playing, listening to music, speaking with my internet friends on mumble. that is enough for me. yea, i ca not go on like that, that is what my parents say. i ca not. but man, i am depressed. i ca not concentrate on any studies because they do not make any sense to me. i ca not see tomorrow, tomorrow is too far away, so today seems pointless. why should i go to school? i can just stay at home, feel comfortable and not have any problems... because next to my depression , i am a pretty nervous guy too. agoraphobic, claustrophobic, and probably some others except fear of blood and needles, but more about that a bit after . so going out is hell for me. it is not that i do not like people. it is just that i always feel in the way. my personal bubble must be huge, if someone comes next to me at less than meter i feel the urge to move away to make place. now i am not skinny but i am not morbidly obese either. i am not as much in the way as i think i am. if you want to have an image of myself, think of someone of m ft and kg pounds with a babyface and dark brown short hair. if you see me in the street i will probably be nervous and sweating more than i want to. if you are my friend you will see me as someone generally kind and patient, cold blooded and a good friend in general. more than what i like to call a repulsive body that might be just my thinking actually, but there has not been too many girls to say the contrary... i have something inside not really working. you see, i have diabetes. type . if you do not know what that implies, let me explain it really quick basically, my pancreas does not produce insulin. insulin is a hormone that is needed to make the sugar go from the blood to the muscles a bit like a key that needs to open a door . so as a diabetic i need to inject myself insuline, and to watch out for my sugar levels... etc. explains that i have no fear anymore for blood and needles since it is been about years that i suffer from that. it is not a hard illness to live with, just gotta watch out and stay healthy ! . now that is my problem. as a mildly depressed and not caring about anything year old man, i do not exactly do what is called staying healthy . i eat whatever, do not do any exercice and i do not even care about my glycemy blood sugar level . the impact is not too big at the moment since i still do my injections i have already been hospitalized once for stopping the injections, really was not great at all. , but since i do not check my sugar levels i practically do the same every time. the result of eating badly and not knowing where i am speaking of sugar levels makes that i have a high sugar level every time. and as you can imagine. having a lot of sugar in your blood means it can get stuck and make me get some problems. like emboly followed by a necrosis in the feet. well. that is pretty bad, but i can also get blind, get renal problems cause the sugar you do not use gets pissed out , and many others. great, but i ca not feel anything of that at the moment. so with my legendary motivation, why should i care about something that will happen in years? that is exactly the problem. i ca not even know what tomorrow will be, so i ca not project myself years forward. everyone tries to morale me by saying you need to do something with your life, you need to change, something needs to happen. you ca not just stay behind your computer and do nothing right? ah... sometimes i wish i could. see, if i had a great passion for something it might be a reason for me to go for it. but videogames are not a passion. or well they can be, but they are generally not accepted by other people. and it is pretty fucking hard to make money out of it. so no, i ca not be passionate about dota and make my life out of it. too fucking bad. because you see, the first signs of depression showed themselves in my last year of highschool, year . i stopped school in march because of stress, lack of interest, and just not getting any good friends i changed school for the last year which is pretty stupid, but i had my reasons. so after seeing many coaches, shrinks, etc i decided to pass some exam that would let me get into any college university you call it of my choice in my country. it was not too hard and i was happy of passing it. so next year, boom, computer science. looks fun, i want to make games. i was already pretty fond of valve games at that moment so my dream was to go work there once i got out of that school. that never happened, like said, i quit after christmas break. i got racketted in october which made my general anxiety worse too, and it was getting too much for me. so there go more months of pretty much doing nothing, seeing a therapist and a doctor, getting some pills, and trying to get out of it. next schoolyear september i did not do anything. i did not join a school because i thought i could not. it looked like it was too much for me. and my parents especially my mother accepted that. maybe they should not have. i do not know, but it is gone anyway. i have gone through some projects since then but nothing quite serious and here we are, march , and i still do not fucking know what i am gonna do. all i take are chinese classes once per week. it is an interesting language and at least i get out of my room, but it is not much. for some time i thought i was never going to change. i was going to stay depressive because i just could not find a way out. my mother thought i needed to get better on my diabetes before getting better mentally because for her there was a pretty solid link between both. but how do i get a healthier life if i hardly find the motivation to get out of my bed in the morning? well, that was until now. do not even ask, yes people have tried to tell me everything to get me going. people getting on it morally, saying you have to do something, it is like that . did not work. social projects helping people out of school to get back into it? not even a little bit motivated. actually, i hated people until now. everyone. i thought i was way more intelligent than the rest and that most of the people did not deserve my attention. so it was hard accepting someone to help me too. i was and still am , pretty hard into art. oh yeah, you know those guys, they have better taste than you and they like to say it. well yeah. i like to say it too, sorry. i am pretty involved into music and i hate people not accepting to listen to something just because they are comfortable with what they are hearing themselves. oh, what a hypocrite i am. they act about music like i act about life. and i judge them. well, not even days ago. i have found my truth. my motivation, my way to get going. and i found my explanation too. and this is mainly why i am writing this. because i think it can help. the visual novel that changed my life is pretty known on chan. it is called katawa shoujo . it is not really japanese, it is been made by people from the a board. if you do not know what it is about, let me explain in some words basically, it is about a school for cripples. the protagonist joins that school in the middle of the year after discovering he suffers from some pretty dangerous heart disease. now yea, it is based on japanese culture, so do not judge me for that but there are a lot of nude scenes involving pretty hardcore sex. and it is a dating sim. yep. oh god what am i going to read, how can some weeaboo shit change my way of seeing life . we will get to it allright. give me a second. i will turn on the music of the game, it will help me remember everything i need to tell. if you want to follow me, here are the links katawa shoujo is great. the game starts by one main path dividing in paths that depend on who you choose to date. and every character has its own little personalities and quirks. i have learned a lot about this. so you get to make choices sometimes... and some choices can be pretty harsh. if you do not get close to any girl before the path divides into , you die. it is as simple as that. and that is what happened to me the first time. man, that was a direct punch to the face. ouch. not because the dying is gore, just because you die if you do not make decisions. do you think i am the kind of guy who makes any decisions? no i do not. i am a coward. i flee from every hard situations. i do not choose things, things choose for me. so i decided to be loyal to myself and stay passive. if this was real life i would be dead since looooooong. anyway, my first real choice, and the first path i follow is the one of emi. emi is this sporty girl with no legs who always wants to push herself and who wants to help hisao, the protagonist, get a better physical health by forcing him into running. if you want to get the emi way, you have to force yourself further than what you think you can, and the game becomes interesting from that point. it basically says stop bathing in your comfort and do something or nothing will happen . after that you start running with her, eating lunch, etc, until a kiss comes and it is beautiful love. really beautiful actually. or at least you think it is. after some time, you discover that she is hiding things from you. the reason is she is scared of becoming close to someone, because she is also scared of losing that person. so the rest of this path is about questioning her about it, getting her trust without going too far and getting the bad end. so basically, not too hard. the story is her dad died when she lost her legs, sad sad thing. an accident and she blames herself. well. what is interesting about her is not her story. it is the fact that she pushes you, that she gives you her hand so you can become better. she is like a piston, trying to make you get better with such an optimism and a strength you would barely notice she has had a hard life until then. this is the moment when ks touched me for the first time. until i finished emi is path i did not think too much about it, it was fun but the nude scenes were bothering me because they were pretty unrealistic. after that, i had a hard time sleeping. not kidding. i actually could not sleep. it made me think and it made me kinda sad. it made me think because it was a beautiful love story with all it is details. and it made me sad because... i wish it happened to me. hisao the main character, remember? is pretty much like me. this guy needs to take his pills while i need to inject myself, he needs to stay healthy as i do, etc. you can now understand. meeting someone like emi in real life would be the greatest thing to ever happen to me. meeting someone who can motivate me and push me further. i would love that to happen. i have never loved someone you know. i do not know what it feels to see someone as perfect. the only relationships i lived were on the internet i know, i know so i do not know what love is. would i want to know what it is? you bet i do, especially after reading playing ks. for the last few months i did not care too much well i was subscribed to two different meeting sites but never got quite into it . all was about my games and just the fact of getting comfortable. but now... now that is all i want. the second path i took in katawa shoujo was lilly... listen to it and you basically understand the character. lilly is a classy girl who is completely blind. she likes to drink tea and to stay with her dear and protected friend hanako. you get on her path by defending her and trying to talk with hanako who is pretty shy. her path story gets more interesting with the time. in the beginning it is just doing normal things with her, like staying indoors with her and hanako, going for some shopping, drinking tea, etc. but it gets good. really good. no point in explaining how they get together. the ending is the most important. the only way to end this well is to always, at every moment, be sincere to her. now she is pretty calm and reserved so it is normal. but one false step, and you do not ever see her again. at the end of this whole romance, lilly gets a call from her family that wants her back to where they live, in scotland remember the story takes place in japan to begin with . lilly accepts even if she loves hisao more than everything as she says herself. the path is the same whatever your choices are until the moment she has to leave. if you have been sincere to her all the time in your choices, you will try to get her back. but if you do not it is done one she says she leaves. it is pretty weird if you ask me. you actually have influence on hisao. hisao himself takes his own decisions following yours. if all is good, hisao goes to the airport, gets a heart attack right before getting to her and goes to the hospital. at his wakeup, lilly is there. waiting for him. not wanting to leave anymore. all the feelings come at that moment... not because it is a beautiful story again like emi, even if it really is one... but the fact that just saying no, come back with me changes everything. just go for it , that is what ks says. if you love her, keep her at all costs. beat destiny. you know what i realized at that time? it is that i have been a fucking dumbass all my life. i have been running away from every opportunity and now i hate the world for leaving me in such a bad mood. if katawa shoujo taught me one thing, it is this nothing will happen if you do not take risks. nothing will happen if you do not move yourself. maybe for you it seems normal, but for me it took until now to get into my head. and then it struck me. like... like a bullet strikes the skull and gets into your brain. i have always had a passion for... for people. socializing. other lifes. i never quite knew it because i was scared. my fear was blocking my sight of what i really loved. being around others. have you ever done the briggs myer test? it is that thing that is supposed to tell you your personality, if you are introvert or extrovert, etc. well i have taken it. i am supposed to be infp. that means, introvert intuition feelings perception. i am not going to explain it totally now, but you can find what that means on the internet. well i think the test is wrong. i think i am extrovert. seriously. i have always been of the curious and listening type. people amaze me, not in their general way of being, but deep into their convictions. i would want to talk the fuck out of people sorry for the expression . this is what this game , or visual novel showed me. i have been wrong all along. i do not need to get moving because of some morals. i do not need to go to college for a job. i do not even need to get a job. that is not important. and nobody told me that it was not important. having a life, a job, a family. those are not causes. those are consequences. consequences of being around people, sharing enthousiasm about things, sharing passions. tell whatever you want, but in my opinion you ca not get away in your life by just following your feelings. you ca not ignore the image other people have of you. people around you are important. and connections are important. more than anything. that is why you do not feel well when you are in front of your computer. i do not say that being addicted to games is a cause of your depression, it is more of a consequence. but being addicted to that virtual world does not make it better. i do not really care about that virtual world now. you know what i want? i desperately want to fall in love. with someone who can motivate me, someone who can teach me things and who i can protect and listen to in exchange. but for that i need to get healthy and in shape. not really because i would be too unattractive well that is also a part of it , but because i think i need to feel well before loving someone. it is stupid right? that is what it takes to make me totally change. in years nothing has helped me more than this game. because ks showed me what i really wanted. love, respect, and people around me in general. it does not make me desperate. but i already see life way more positively than before. i want to change. i want to be someone for someone else. i want people to remember my name, to think positively on me. fuck the ones who say that image should not matter. you should matter. absolutely. it what is important on this planet. being there for someone else. that is what love is on the long term. no moral is enough to make me think this. so if you are in the same position as me. begin loving people. stop staying alone, smile at someone, and they will smile at you. probably. if they do not, try someone else. one will reply with a huge smile and you know that you were useful this day on this planet. from as soon as possible i will start running in the mornings, waking up early enough, i will eat healthy. and next year. wait for me people i will meet. because i will be there. i will meet, i will understand, i will be someone. i think i am not depressed anymore. ps you can get katawa shoujo for free. but... if you are easily shocked by nudity, do not think you should get interested in it. also, sorry if i am not clear at times. if you want more info just ask.",depression

0.35486162,108.323906,"my depression the thoughts of a year old depressed guy. i am afraid of, well not afraid but the things i think about on a regular basis. i worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy ex wife. i worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because i have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my ex wife. i want to do all these things, but i am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them. i want to start a business and be successful, but i am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where i am, which is like resetting my whole life. i worry about if i am going to get cancer because i am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because i don t want it to influence her life because i have been told it is bad for you. i worry about being alone the rest of my life because i can t seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because i am to shallow and don t think anyone over lbs. is pretty. i can t sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind. i worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because i don t want to show how unsuccessful i am right now. i feel like a failure and a worthless person. the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter. and if i wasn t here who would raise her. the pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing? is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable? is the right thing what i think is right? but then why do other people think some of the things i do are wrong? what makes them right? i think about the things in my past that i could have done differently but what s the point? i can t change them so why do i dwell on them? do i need to even worry about them? i worry about how i am going to pay for things if i lose my va disability but i don t want to go to my va appointments because i feel it reinforces the fact that i am messed up and i come up with excuses as to why i shouldn t go. to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go. it s also a distance away which wastes hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing. so is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for mins telling him that every things ok and i take meds, which i don t take my meds because i hate taking medication every day and i don t like to think taking them helps but they do because if i took them then i might not be writing this. i know i need to do better but i work at a dead end job that has no future for me. i am just a pawn in someone else s business story. i want to make more money, but i don t know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and i am afraid to start anything just to fail. i don t want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event. but why do i worry about an unforeseen event when i can t even see it coming. is my life that messed up that i am worried about something that may or may not happen. i sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself i need to do better for my daughter. what example am i setting for her if i don t do anything with my life. i thought i had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw. everyone told me i shouldn t have been with that girl. everyone told me i needed to leave her. but as clich why did i just look up how to spell clich in something i am only going to read as it sounds, i loved her. or at least what i thought was love. i was ready to spend my life with her, but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others. but blamed me because she thought i had an affair . which i didn t have an affair. i write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and i will not worry about them anymore. but for how long is it going to last? is this really going to help? maybe i ll post this on some reddit website and become famous for it. ha who am i kidding. i am nobody. i am a middle age man who has been handed a fucked up life and can t get out. but it s not as fucked up as some people s lives so why does mine hurt so bad? maybe i am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them. like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one i want because i am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me. i am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything. i tell myself i am meant for more, but i don t know how to get there. i am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy. so, am i really that smart? i can tell you all night and day that i am smarter than what i am doing right now but have nothing to show for it. i think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form, i don t trust anyone, i think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but don t we all. is anyone truly selfless? now i am just rambling to ramble so focus, focus on why i am writing this. focus focus focus why why am i handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions? is that life? what s the purpose? why do i even waste my time? why can t i win the lottery and hide behind the money at least i will be able to do the things that make me happy because i won t be constrained by money? but if i did have it would i really be happy? i think it would be better than where i am. but why would i be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me? is luck a figment of our imaginations? are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power? some might say i am on drugs right now to think like this. i m not. this is how my mind works and i think it s a blessing and a curse. who will even read this? now it s just becoming to long for the quick reader to think it s interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but i m not writing it for them i am writing it for myself. i want to get better i want to do better. but where are the answers? do i make up the answers and hope i get by? do i tell lies and belittle other people to get through life? why not? it feels like other people, all people do it to me. who is coming to punish those who do me wrong? do i do it? no, why? because i am afraid of the consequences. i am pressured by everyone to do the right thing. maybe that s what governs people? then why doesn t everyone act the same? are there to many questions in this? who cares? its mine right, maybe i will share this so someone can laugh, someone can feel empowered to do the same? someone can belittle me? i need to do better i need to push myself to do better. i started working out because i thought i might get laid if i look better. but is anyone even going to notice? i wasn t in shape before and got laid, sort of i more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better, then when that wears off, i am alone am i going to be alone for the rest of my life? at least i have my daughter, right? but eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me i wouldn t want to be around me. i always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you you have to love yourself before anyone can love you who am i kidding i will always be alone because i don t see myself loving myself. i am fat, ugly and stupid. i don t have any value. i don t have the ability to love anyone else because i just want to use the other person to make myself feel better. but how is that? does that even make sense? am i connecting with anyone? if this is circulating around and you are reading this far, then possibly? should i keep going? maybe i still feel like going. my fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me. maybe it s because i am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience. so, things i worry about. i worry about paying bills, but i am good at financial stuff. so that s ok but i still worry about them. i worry that i am not doing the right thing. i worry about what other people think of me but that s ridiculous. i should not worry about that right? i worry about the spelling in this, but i have spell check. i worry about sleeping all day when i have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is . i also worry she is going to grow up and think i just slept all the time, but she doesn t know i was up until am writing a stupid paper about the things i worry about. but that s not her fault. i worry about making a good impression on the people around me because i don t want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now. i seem to piss everyone else off. why do i piss them off? because i am pushing people away so they can t hurt me. is that an excuse? i worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities, but should i? i worry about being someone else s burden, i don t want to hinder someone else s life with my inability to love myself. it is no one s problem but my own. but there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering. cancer maybe that s too much. i definitely can t post this anywhere now. i worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day. i worry that all of this will pile up and i ll do something i can t take back. but that s why i think of my daughter, i worry i ll be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because i am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better. i worry about anything and everything. i don t care about anyone other than my daughter truly, her life is the only real thing i care about. she is so innocent, am i contaminating her life by being in it though? is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me? i hope not. i see the negative in everything. i can t think fast but when i do think at my own pace, i can figure shit out. i worry about being in a situation i can t think my way out of. i truly worry about everything. my daughter is being pushed into school. well i think so. her mother doesn t want her to not be in school, because she is ready. i think it s because her mom doesn t want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her. she seems too young to start preschool in my mind. why do i care so much about what my ex wife is doing or thinks? maybe it is because i have to deal with her for the rest of my life, not like she is going away and i can t not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then i will lose my daughter. i don t want that now do i. i feel like my ex wife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like i am trying to do? but i m the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings. i don t want to lose my daughter but everything i do i am feeling like it is a movement on a chess board and at any moment i am going to get check mated. who even uses a term like that anymore? apparently, i do. i worry about who is going to care for my daughter when i am not around. i worry she will fall into something and i can t save her. literally and figuratively. i worry my life is pointless then i think of her smile and watch videos of her, and it makes me happy. i worry i am a burden on people, and no one wants to deal with me, so i try to hide myself. i feel i am not good at anything. or not good enough. i feel lonesome tired afraid and beaten down. i have to many struggles. too much on my mind. emotionless. defeated. unintelligent, worthless, hopeless. who thinks like this? i do. i have depression.",depression

15.684838,-9.850299,"i have lied and screwed up big time to the one person who i love more than anything. she could die and i do not have much time to save her. i do not know what to do. so i started playing this video game about months ago. although i am a girl, i made my account male and played on the game as a male character. i quickly gained a group of friends that i grew closer and closer to, they believed i was a boy. after a few months, we exchanged discords and started talking on there. they sent pictures of themselves and brought their real lives into our originally just online friendships. i realized they expected me to talk about my life as well. i created a fake persona with my friend is pictures. he was an attractive boy who i knew really well although i never told him i was using his pictures. i never thought too much about my friendships with these people, sure i was catfishing them but i did not want anything out of it. i did not take pleasure in deceiving them, i just enjoyed their company, advice, and funny stories that always cheered me up. i valued them even if they did not know the real me. i might tell you now the persona i was pretending to be was of a blonde, blue eyed, tall year old boy. not model material but decently attractive. in reality, i am a year old girl with pale skin, a few freckles, light chestnut hair, and dark chocolate eyes. there was nothing important or crazy about me or the person i said i was. there was nothing about me scary or shocking i was hiding. i would call myself in reality pretty to an extent, i am thin and have an okay life. anyways, i met somebody else on the game when i was playing with a few of my online friends. at the time their character was a boy and i did believe them to be male. but i would later find out they were actually a girl playing on a male account, just like i was. i should tell you now i am pansexual. but before they told me their true identity, we started an online relationship together, both believing the other was a boy. the person, whose name is axel, was also pansexual. at first, the bond between us was just an internet thing and nothing more. but slowly we elevated things until we too exchanged discords. axel also informed me they were really a girl, and i told them i cared about them the same no matter what gender hence pansexuality . but i still did not tell them what gender i really was. my relationship with axel was so much more than anything i had with my other friends axel was friends with them too because of me . we began to tell each other that we loved one another and i truly meant it. over the course of almost exactly one month, they became my absolute everything. we would tell each other almost everything, our fears, insecurities, wishes, etc. we would make the other feel loved and safe. we stayed up past am talking and laughing and sending the most ridiculous memes. those memories make my life. i would have done anything for ax. but she still did not know who i really was. the closer we got the harder it was for me to admit to her my true identity. i began to think i would lose her and everything we had together, they truly were my everything. i had struggled with depression and not having a will to live for a long time. my life had gotten too stressful, painful, and pointless for me to want to be alive any longer. but these people were my breakthrough, especially axel. all i want is for her to accept who i am, but i have no idea how to tell her that. i have made up entire stories and lies about this fake life of mine who i call zach axel calls ame zachy . she is known me all this time as a boy who i look nothing like. i would like to think she will love me anyway, because in truth my personality, feelings, and overall life interests who i am is correct. just my outer appearance is a lie. she has been hurt so many times in the past and if i tell her this whole time i have not even been honest about my identity i am worried she will commit suicide. she has threatened to do so in the past for various reasons and is extremely suicidal. but i have gotten caught in a bad situation. she wants to meet up this winter break and i agreed to facetime her two days ago so her parents will let her meet up with me, but of course, i ca not do that currently, and i have not responded since i have not responded to her for days . she is told me if i ever just randomly disappear she will kill herself so i do not have much time before i have to say something. i am debating breaking up with her which i really do not want to do , somehow finding a way around face timing her i do not know what this is , or coming clean. the last message she is sent to me since checking was i do not know whether to be worried or doubtful . this makes me want to cry. i do not know what to do. i truly am in love with her and she might be the only person that has ever truly understood me, yet she does not even know who i really am on the outside. i know i have lied and messed up. i know this is entirely my fault. but i am asking you for help now because i truly want to do the best thing. disappearing is not an option for me and this

i gladly welcomed her again and declared i will stay for one more shift. we sat in circle line and talked with the whole shift, telling histories and jokes. i even chatted a little with her, about how we will never meet, so she created fb account to be in touch. she went then to this industrial pool of water and leaned against it. i approached her from behind and lifter, above the water, as if i were to throw her in the water. she instinctively grabbed me by my neck and smiled. and then i realized, wait a moment, it is a dream, innit? so i woke up. it was minutes before the alarm clock to go of. you see, i wrote all of this, because in all this madness, all this crazy fuckery that was going on in this little dream, being this close to me, the way this girl looked at me with joy and... maybe not love, but adoration it was the most abstract thing for me, that tipped me off that all of this is just a dream. and just as i was thinking i am about to turn the corner, i feel shattered again.",depression

but i ca not stop thinking like that . my life feels quite meaningless. i have been cruel to people i have cheated on a few of my past boyfriends, i do not know if i did not care, or if i used it as a means to break up for good, or maybe it is both. i do not have friends for so long since i either just fade away because i would rather be alone for some time, or because i start being mean or quarrel with them not sure why i do this, might be because i feel it will be easier to take my own life with no friends . i am not really good at anything either, and i really feel like i ca not contribute to society. i am currently in university, but my grades are horrible and i am barely pulling through, i do not know if i can go on to a masters degree. i ca not quit either, because then i would have to get a job or move back with one of my parents, and both of those seems impossible. i do not know if i can get a serious job, or even hold on to a job. the last part time job i had, i had to quit because i got exhausted for a couple of days after working. as for my parents i really have trouble staying with them for more than a couple of days. my childhood were not horrible, but i feel like my parents did not do a very good job emotionaly. i fell like my dad kind of abandoned us when he and mom split up, even though he still wanted us over and said he were ther for us and all that jazz. i quarreled a lot with my mom in my teenage years, she drank a lot, and were not really a good mother. one time it got so bad that she said she wished i were not born, and that have really stuck with me since then ten years later . everytime i have tried to talk about how i feel with either of them i really have not felt like they have understood or even tried to really understand. it sucks with my mom, because i thought she would understand since she has struggled with anxiety for a really long time. my dad will say he understand, but later he will tell me to get a grip or something like that, and that is really not what you want to hear when you are depressed. it is basically the same when i have tried to tell my friends or boyfriends. recently my self esteem has been lower than usual do not know how that is possible . i think it is because of my current boyfriends ex. we hade some problems before we really got together, and they had a thing or something, it was really stupid. but now i feel like i project everything about how i want to be onto her, even though i do not know her, i just think she have to be perfect. it makes it hard everytime i see her, even though it is been two years since my boyfriend and i started to become a thing. i also want to break up with him, because i feel like i am just pulling him down, and he deserves someone who is not a mess. i ca not do it, he is really all i have right now. i think i have struggled with depression and anxiety since i were , possibly before, but my memory is not that great and my childhood is a little bit fussy although my mom has said that i have been weird since i were a child . my anxiety got worse when i was , and when i was and had moved out it got so bad that i had to ask my roommate to buy groceries for me because i had not really eaten since yesterday morning. i went to a psychologist at , and things became manageable after i got on some meds, but then i stopped going and using meds when i were or something i do not really remember , because i did not like the new psychologist i went to. my anxiety are not that bad now, but i still have problems going places without people i know, and sometimes i have to ask my boyfriend to buy me food because i ca not go out of my room, but yeah. i also go to group therapy right now, but i do not really feel like i fit in, i ca not manage to say anything, and i do not feel like my problems are anything compared with the other peoples problems. i want to quit, but i do not know what to do afterwards, i have to get control of a little bit of my life so i do not become a total failure. so yeah, i feel like my life is a mess it has been for ages anyways , and i do not feel like i can do anything to change it. it feels like everything i do fails because i always end up in the same spot misearble and alone. and now i just feel like i have no control over anything, and i am already a year late in my degree, and i feel really alone, and i feel like i ca not talk to anyone about it. i am sorry, this got really rambling y.",depression

6.4086366,-52.54474,"most accurate description of opiates the following, from an erowid report i found, really hits the nail on the head when high on opium the experience of emotions of pure joy and elation that came from having attained no actual achievement were so profound that they were stored in the memory like they were inspired by peak life event experiences so important that they were never to be forgotten. just sitting on the couch playing a car racing game for instance, or watching music videos in the early morning darkness and fighting off sleep to drain from the experience just a few more moments of the heart is beaten jolts of pleasure were riveting memories artificially enhanced to the mind by the flow of endorphin like chemicals. i think this is part of the drug is psychologically addictive nature because it creates these unnaturally fantastic scenarios out of what could be without the drug effects seen as from the purely doldrum and routine. for me, at least, this perfectly describes one of the most powerful aspects of opiates, which ensnared me in addiction quickly. this can happen at any stage of the addiction but is especially prominent early on i remember the first week i smoked bth years ago, how just nodding off to shitty reality television seemed like a transcendent experience both at the time and as stored in memory. i guess this relates back to the whole chasing the dragon concept you are always chasing some high in particular, it may have been the first time or the first time you shot up or it may be that one time last month or it may have been years ago... but it is as if the experience of getting high is inextricably linked to nostalgia itself, it is a kind of attempted recreation of some past perceived glory. and it is so very hard to have the current experience live up to the greatness of the old one. but hey, if i just keep on doing it maybe next time i will get as euphoric and high as i did that one time. so you keep chasing it, going around in circles. on and on. and it is obviously a hard cycle to break, because typically the process of chasing that perfect high still results in you getting high all the time maybe not as high as the best time, but still nice and toasted. it is so very easy to just continue doing this, and to be content not doing much else in life. i remember an addict i used to know who said that the worst thing about opiates was that they made boredom acceptable and even desirable. at the time, as an early, on off junkie who was fiending badly but without a connect, i just got irritated at him and brushed the comment off. today, as a junkie who is been on subs for a few years and still treats them like any other opiate in terms of addict behavior ... i find i could not agree more with him. nothing is more dangerous than embracing that boredom and inaction and complete apathy toward anything besides dope.",drug_addiction

0.8437127,103.51567,"as promised...here is my most frightening experience with worth of h and a cop... quite long...but worth it first, i want to apologize for how long this is going to be. this was in early october . my girlfriend who used to post here from time to time...not sure if any of you know her or recognize the name u frodo lives and i were new to heroin. we both had regular scripts for pain meds vicodin for me, percocet for her , as i had have a back issue, and she had severe stomach pain severe ibd with colitis hernias . a friend of mine introduced us to h when we were both out of our scripts, and she was in immense pain. i attempted to get pills, but could not find any. we both were against hopping on the heroin train, but given the amount of pain she was in, we said fuck it. we never really became addicted...it just became like a weekend thing. bought a bunch for the weekend and have a good time, then stabilize throughout the week. one weekend in november, we were hanging out, and again she was in quite a bit of pain with no pain meds. her refill day was about days away. so i asked her if she wanted me to run and get some dope, and of course she said yes. now, she lived about an hour away from where i live, and that is where i had to go since the only dealer i knew was in my city. so i made the trip, bought worth, and started the hour long trip back to her house. about halfway through the trip, i began to feel weird. nauseous as fuck, and a bit drowsy. i did not do a line since i do not like being doped up and driving especially for such a long trip , and it had been over a week since i had anything, so i was not going through withdrawals or anything. i still have no explanation as to what i was feeling. i made the decision to get off on the next exit and find a speedway to buy a sprite or up for my stomach. once on the exit, i lost control of the car it had started to rain a bit as well , and ended up slamming into a tree. my immediate thought was, fuck! i am fucked! since i had worth of heroin in my laptop bag, and the cops are surely going to come. so i began thinking...i am in a wooded area, it is a single car accident...cops wo not be here for at least a few minutes. that gives me enough time to stash the dope in the woods somewhere. and that is when a female cop knocked on my window... she asked if i was okay and if i had been drinking and all...standard procedure. i explained to her what happened...i was taken out of the car, frisked, and given a breathalyzer, which i absolutely passed. i ended up sitting in the back of her car while she assessed the situation, and called someone to tow my car. it was stuck between two trees, and it was impossible to get out without chainsawing one of the trees. now, that would upset anyone...losing your car that way, having no transportation, not even knowing what city you are in. but me..? i was just concerned about my stash. she comes back to me and says, well, you obviously wo not be able to drive this. can you get a ride somewhere? i told her yes, and then she asked me if there was anything in the car that i needed. my phone, and...uhhh...my laptop bag. she goes to retrieve those items, and i begin to piss my pants figuratively . now...there are two things you should know. one, the heroin i got was in capsules which is my preferred method...fucking hate baggies , and i had put them in one of my prescription bottles for vicodin. i do not know if any of you are familiar with the bottles that the target pharmacy uses or used to use...i think they are cvs now , but they were shaped oddly, and were a dark red color instead of the standard amber. so it is a bit more difficult to actually determine what is in those bottles unless you open it. the cop comes back to me, and i am waiting to hear the dreaded question of the worth of heroin i have. she hands me my phone and my laptop bag, and says, you know...some of those prescriptions you have in that bag can cause drowsiness. did you take any of them? i also had a blood pressure medication, zoloft, and ativan. i said, well yes, but in the morning when i am supposed to. have not taken anything since then. and then she says... there was a knife in the car with some blood on it. you know anything about that? i had totally forgotten about the knife. what it was and this is my explanation to her as well was a pathetic cry for attention fake suicide attempt. it was my blood on the knife from about a week or so ago. i have borderline personality disorder, and we often resort to threats of suicide when faced with perceived abandonment, and that is what that was. i showed her my pseudo scars from the attempt, and told her that i was kept in a psych ward for days, and told her that she could call them to verify if she wanted. she says, no, there is no need for that. i believe you. however, i should cite you for ovi because of the prescriptions. but i wo not. she cited me for failure to operate, handed me her business card, and said i was free to go. at that moment, i suddenly became religious i am an atheist , because that had to be divine intervention, yeah? god came down and stopped her from identifying the worth of heroin in my vicodin bottle. end of the story here...i walked over to a mcdonald is and got a sprite and a mcchicken plain...fuck you mayonaise , and got an uber to take me the remaining miles or so to the girlfriend is house. and once i arrived...i told her this story. and then we cut up our lines to snort with that business card that the cop gave me. i seriously want to write this scene into one of my screenplays, but it is actually been difficult to translate to that format. once again, i apologize for how long this is. like i said in the previous thread...i ramble and i love adding unnecessary details. i am a storyteller, dammit! what are some of your close calls? oh, also...if any of you did know u frodo lives from her infrequent posts here, i should tell you that she passed away in march . not from an overdose or anything drug related. it was her aforementioned stomach issues. it was a stomach rupture gastric hemorrhage . it is been almost months since she is been gone, and i am still grieving as if it is only been a day. love of my life and all. sorry for the downer ending, but i figured i would update about her just in case anyone knew her. tl dr wrecked my car after buying worth of heroin, somehow the cop on the scene did not notice said heroin, despite looking in the bag where it was",drug_addiction

what s done is done. the driver doesn t have two nickels to rub together so legal action would ve done no good. the point is, i m taking life as it comes, and not worrying about things beyond my control. i m more accepting and open to life s curveballs and take them in stride. insurance ended up paying out more than what i paid for the vehicle so it ultimately turned out fine, but i wasn t bothered by it at all during any time of the ordeal. i m also physically more productive with my work. my workspace is clean and organized. i meet my deadlines. i m just more with it because of the psilocybin md s. this stuff is medicine. and it s very powerful medicine. i feel i have a new lease on life. life could not be more opposite for me than it was months ago. hopefully this strikes a chord with someone who is researching micro dosing psilocybin for depression anxiety. it has made a world of difference in my life. thanks for coming to my ted talk. tl dr micro dosing psilocybin for months and two macro doses in that time has cured my depression of years and i ve stopped smoking cigs and no longer drink alcohol. my business and personal relationships have improved. i am an overall happy person.",drug_addiction

my therapist and i have talked though the complicated stuff and i have learned how to handle new things as they arise. i still have a few things that i am weird about though, i feel like the occasional concession is alright... one is my car... it has to be clean... as an extension of my contamination fears i am very particular of the cleanliness of the inside of the car, i have a routine for cleaning disinfecting the interior occasionally. this also extends to a point to the outside of the car, i am not fond of it being dirty in the aesthetic sense but also i kind of obsess over it cleanliness in the contamination sense. i have a car wash i like to go to, it is nice and clean and touchless aka no dirty brushes and what not so periodically i hit that and i am all good, i know it is stupid to obsess over contamination on the outside of my car... roads are dirty so by extension your car is exterior might be a bit dirty, most people do not care... and it is not like i am eating off of it. that sets the scene for tonight, it is about to snow bad here... no big deal where i am from but still you make adjustments to your plans. i am taking off of work tomorrow which is nice, but before the storm hits i decide to run to the grocery store, better tonight than tomorrow morning. i head out on my drive and all is good for the first few mintues, but then there was something in the road as i got to the freeway onramp... it looked like a ceramic pot or something but i did not get a good look at it, i did not run over it but as i turned onto the onramp my car came close to it. immediately my stupid brain took over telling me it was something gross and the outside of my car was contaminated. ok... i tell myself... maybe it is ok to make a concession to my ocd, i have been good at telling it no lately. it just so happened that my favorite carwash is right down the road from the store i am going to pick up a few things at, two birds with one stone... my car is dirty winter roads salt etc as it is so it kind of made sense to get it washed anyways as well. i hit the store and things go fine there, then head down the road to the carwash... it is automatic and runs hours a day... except for today... it is closed... why i do not know... i head home annoyed. you see i am still a little weird about my car being dirty , and i ca not always get it washed like for example tonight, and when that happens and i do not feel like arguing internally with my ocd i park it on the street so as to not contaminate my driveway. this whole fear of contaminating is especially present when it snows... if my car contaminates the snow in the driveway then it might be there for months off to the side of the driveway. so right now my car is parked on the street, with inches of snow on the way... fortunately where i live they have not declared a snow emergency so i wo not get towed but i ca not help but feel like a complete idiot... all the neighbors have gotten their cars off the street and mine is still out there. i also feel like a jerk to create an obstacle for the plow drivers, they have a hard enough job as it is without dodging cars. fortunately i drive a rather large and capable suv so getting out of the almost inevitable snow bank around my car in the morning should be no problem. but now i am even obsessing about brushing off my car in the morning... what if i get some of the dirty snow on me and then i get into the car, then the interior is dirty. this is a trend for me like every months, it is like ocd is this big tall structure i have learned to live with, i have learned to brace it with the techniques i have learned in therapy, i control it and keep it standing and out of my way so to speak, but every once in a while a big wind comes along and blows the whole freaking thing down on my head. for now i am sitting at home watching the snow fall, it is freaking gorgeous and i do love living in a place that gets it and a lot of it at that , but damn does it do weird things to me and my ocd occasionally. so that is my setback for now, if you made it this far thanks for reading, i know the sub rules, so i feel like saying that in no way am i looking for reassurance, i know i will figure it out on my own, but i just wanted to pass on my story about how my dumb ass brain ruined what has been a pretty good few months. of course my x weekly therapy is on mondays and thursdays, and my therapist is office is closed tomorrow because it is going to be crazy on the roads, so i finally have a serious issue to discuss with my therapist and i have to wait till thursday. it is funny how this stuff happens is not it?

0.7045522,104.89138,"my existence is worthless and pathetic i am an year old guy with a shitty life. no matter what i do, i end up finding people who despise and bully me. i always end up feeling lonely, and without any close friends. for once in my life, i just want at least one close friend who understands me. there is probably something wrong with me that is pushing everyone away. with the amount of people that hate me nowadays, i do not think i can last any longer. i should just die. when i was a young child, i almost seemed to have a great life. i was the well behaved kid who got straight a is and skipped a grade, was well loved by my parents, and got along with various adults. that was just the surface. i was constantly bullied in school, and my classmates barely talked to me. the bullying took a toll on me. i became less talkative, more anxious, and less trusting of people. i rarely told teachers that others bullied me because my harassers would find a way to lie and convince that they were innocent. my parents told me to do something to protect myself or fight back, but i never fought back and became a doormat. by the time i was in high school, my social skills had deteriorated so much that friendships seemed impossible to me. it was not like i wanted to befriend anyone at that point, and i was still bullied. people would taunt me and verbally abuse me. i was too damn traumatized to get close to anyone, and spent my free time on video games, anime, and art. i only kept up my grades with brute determination. my cats kept my life sane. at least i got unconditional love from them until they both died. at , i got diagnosed with depression and social anxiety. i went through so many different meds that put my emotions on a roller coaster. one made me feel like a zombie. another just made my depression worse. none of my meds seemed to help, and i just stopped taking them. my high school life was a train wreck. i kept going to high school even though i never ended up getting close to anyone, even though i was bullied, and even though my parents had trouble understanding my depression and social anxiety. getting up to go to school took too much motivation. i skipped most of my school days to stay in bed, and locked myself up in my own room except for going out to use the bathroom or eat. my life was hell. i felt like rotting on the inside. by a stroke of luck, i only managed to graduate high school because i eventually told my guidance counselor about my depression. fast forward to my first semester of college. it was a huge improvement from high school. i found new friends. i was never close to them, but i still enjoyed their company. unfortunately, i was just a tag along. no matter what i do, i could never get close to them. i usually ended up being the butt of all the jokes in the group, and i was a doormat again. they came to me for help, for advice, and to vent about their problems. i did not mind helping them, but whenever i wanted to talk to them about anything, i felt like i was ignored, made fun of, or not taken seriously. one of the few people i actually felt comfortable talking to in that group was another guy who had similar tastes in video games and tv shows. i enjoyed having conversations with him on facebook about them. i did not talk much to him in person compared to online because i thought he would end up thinking that i was a weirdo, and my bad social skills in person probably makes me look stupid in person. then, my second semester came about. i still saw these friends as friends even though they started to get a bit toxic towards me. most of them were not emotionally mature. i remember suddenly feeling really hyper with a ton of energy out of nowhere during that time without taking any drugs. i started to impulsively spend my money on overpriced video games, a new bike, and other dumb things like food i could never finish eating before expiring. i decided to do ten courses in one semester, and somehow survived them all with straight a is. i found a new job, and then felt like quitting it a month later. everything was just crazy. i probably had a case of undiagnosed bipolar mania. i still need to see a psychiatrist about that. summer break started, and my college friends started dislike me more because of how i acted during my second semester. my friendships were shaky. i posted the same things i usually post on facebook my art, jokes and puns, random thoughts on text posts, and reposts of video games and anime related stuff i liked. the only difference was i was still hyper for most of the summer, and posted more stuff than usual. some of my reposts ended up unintentionally being the same post reposted by the friend whom i mentioned that i got along on facebook. it was a coincidence, and i had no idea he reposted them at the time. if there was a friendship hierarchy, my college friends definitely respected him more than me, and i got accused of trying too hard to copy him. i just happened to have similar interests. my college friends played mind games with me, lied to me, and mocked my interests and hobbies on facebook posts and the group chat we were in. i thought college students were more mature than high school students, but nope. i got myself stuck with immature people again. it got to the point where i mentioned to them to stop being shitty towards me. they ended up telling me they hated me, and got kicked out. i ca not even get back into the things i like because of the trauma from everything that happened. if i went through a phase of bipolar mania, then i went back down in depression again. i am back in my own personal hell again. i do not even know if i want to go back to college. with the amount of stress on me, my grades will drop again and it will be even worse than high school since my college is far from home. what makes things even more complicated is that i wanted to transfer to another school the semester after to focus on an animation major because my college does not have an animation major. if i took time off college, i ca not transfer because the transfer application needs a transcript of my grades during the semester right before the semester that i will be transferring to the other college. if i ca not even handle my next semester, how the hell am i going to handle my hellhole of a life? i have pissed off a huge amount of people no matter where i go whether it is my hometown or at college. there is no future for me anywhere. people will hate me anywhere i go. there must be something wrong with me. honestly, i am just so fucking stupid for this rant over some issue that just is not as bad as what other people are going through worrying over some minor issue of human relations and my bad social skills. i am so deep in wallowing in self pity that i am lower than the most disgusting piece of trash. i want to die by next week.",suicidality

even with past relationships, i have always been told to share my feelings more.... i have had long term relationships well... over one year each ... i have never been a sharer of feelings i guess should i note that each of those long terms got engaged to the next man they met? each of them were less than months of knowing them? i have given up on relationships for now. i have been single for around months the longest in years ... never had a one night stand, i am all about meaningful things in my head, just not in person. i guess this has gone on for a little too long... i do not expect anyone to read this far down, except maybe myself later on. i guess we all need ways of relieving stress, writing it down might be one of mine, i will see in time.",suicidality

so why keep going on living, when my options are be alone forever, or go back to the junkie lifestyle with the volatile relationships that come with it. im getting at the end of the rope here and im thinking since most of the people that know me, know ive had a drug problem, that if i were to od that they would think it was an accident. the few people who truly know me deep down would know it was suicide but for the majority of people they would think i just took too much. it will be painless and easy plus ive been obsessed with kurt cobain since i can remember so it will be a nice homage to him. edit for context i have tried to od twice once with dxm and once with xanax both times i had been abusing the drugs so hard and had such a high tolerance i just woke up the next day. maybe someone who knows me will see this after and they will understand me just a little bit better. tldr didn t have a terrible childhood. my happiness is directly proportional to having a gf, but im broken now so ill be forever alone. od will make people think it was an accident.",suicidality
