-44.66304,86.75021,"temptation reveals itself... hello my fellow leavers, day here and i wanted to share something with you all that i know only people like me will truly appreciate. monday was the first day of school for my kids and my daughter was given a homework assignment to collect five things from home which help reflect who she is as a person. as i looked around the house for something she could use i noticed a photo of the two of us in a frame that she had made sitting on the laundry room window sill. perfect, i thought and picked it up off its little stand and gave it to her. as i walked back into the laundry room about minutes later the first thing i noticed was a small bag of weed with decent looking buds in it, sitting on the window sill. my first thought was that it belonged to my husband we are separated but on excellent terms , who was over at the time and who had just popped outside for a joint. i am not overly happy about him smoking around me as i am only a few weeks in but i tried to be chill about it and let it go. i thought he must have left it there accidently after skinning up. i called him into the laundry room and asked him nicely to please be more discreet about his smoking and he straightaway said the weed was not his. i believed him because he would have told me if it was. so now i am standing there with a bag of fucking weed in my hands wondering where the fuck it came from. then i realise it must have been sitting behind that little photo frame of my daughter and i for at least a few months and was probably stashed there by a friend of mine while she was staying with me. she is a bit of a bad influence on me and was supplying me with weed while she stayed with me. she is so scatty that she was always hiding drugs and forgetting where she hid them. and i know for sure i did not stash it there myself and forget, because no matter how wasted i was i would never ever forget about that much weed. as fellow smokers, i am sure you guys can relate to this i was aware at all times exactly how much smoke i had left because i would plan well, try to how long it would last me until i needed to get more. so as i am standing there with this bag in my hand, all these thoughts start going through my mind. like, i ca not believe it has been sitting there this whole time! through times when i was almost out and needed more why did not i find it then every smoker is dream! and i would search around the house for bits too, even though i knew thought there was none. in hindsight i am grateful to the universe for not revealing it to me earlier as it would have just prolonged the agony i was going through whilst trying to stop. as i held it in my hand i even had the crazy thought of keeping it and just having a bit on the weekend. but then i thought about how far i would already come only days at the time but a fucking long time for someone like me and how much better i was feeling. how much my kids needed me to not be a stoner mum anymore. and how i would just met with a wonderful illustrator who was going to work with me on my first children is book. if i kept that weed i would lose everything i had already gained. i am grateful my husband was there at the time because i handed it to him and then it was gone. but those thoughts lingered in my head for a good couple of days after that. it just spun me out so much that it had been sitting there right under my nose for so long. makes me wonder what other bits my friend has stashed that i am yet to find, which worries me a bit. anyway, i just had to share that with you all. a bit of background info about me i am nearly and have smoked daily literally morning til night since i was . in that time i have had years of sobriety at , months at around and a few more months here and there since then. i am tired of that life. enough is enough. if i could go back and talk to my year old self i would beg her to never pick up again. all those wasted years that i can never, ever get back. at i had no internet, no support groups, had not heard of na. i was just given anti depressants by a doctor and sent on my way. it was inevitable that i would pick up again as no one taught me that i needed to completely change my habits and associations. years later and i suffer from anxiety, depression and mood swings. i am desperate not to pass my addiction on to my children as my parents did to me. and to be the best mum i can be someone they can be proud of. but most importantly, to not waste any more of my precious life. you ca not get those years back. thanks so much for reading and i wish each and every one of you the best. i feel very grateful to have found this group.",addiction

my doctor prescribed me adderall but that was it. we had no discussion on the emotional effects of adhd. up until last month, i was convinced adhd was just me being inattentive, i did not understand its effects on my emotions and relationships. my gpa shot up from . to . and i was happy with who i was. then i started reading posts about adhd on this subreddit and realized that adhd was so much more than i initially conceived it to be. i was blown away and immediately started sending posts to j to show her more about adhd. none of these posts were about relationships though, mostly just about me, and my feelings . anyways, over the course of the last month me and j were seeing eachother more frequently, and with this new sense of emotional enlightenment i started to fall deeper and deeper in love with j. i did not tell her, i was scared that the boredom would resurface so i took my time to try to better understand what the boredom meant i didnt understand it as boredom untill later, so i was not able to just talk about it when i wanted to.. . i was struggling to understand why that mental block the boredom, i called it a mental block before i understood it was there and why i could not overcome it. i wanted her but did not want to hurt her again. i personally thought i was about weeks away from understanding the root of this mental block and was so close to telling j that i want to try again. up untill last week, j had expressed interest in being with me, and when we hung out we cuddled and smiled and laughed and i saw the way she looked at me. on monday she told me she loved me and cared about me. i told her i loved her too even after the breakup i told her i loved her because i did, i just could not explain why i had to dump her and it sucked we hung out on wednesday and cuddled and had an amazing time. on friday she told me she met someone else... i had an anxiety attack. i freaked out. i was weeks from getting back together with her and this bombshell comes out of nowhere. since tuesday she had been noticeably distant and i asked her about it and she just said she was busy with work. j would never lie to me, i put so much trust in her and with the way she had treated me for our whole relationship even today, i would never ever believe that she once deceived me. during my panic attack j said she cares about me and will listen to everything i have to say i was spamming messages as i was overwhelmed by emotion . some of my messages said stuff like how could you do this to me etc but after each of those i would say sorry im not blaming you, i am just really sad and emotional i dont mean it like that , i was not being rude or swearing or being aggressive. she started by saying she would read and respond to all my messages but by the end of the night she blocked me. i cant talk to her now. she is gone. i put everything into allowing myself to get back with her and now it is gone. post breakup i researched adhd and relationships and i finally understood this perceived boredom. i wish i knew about it whilst dating her so that i could explain it to her. i wish i was diagnosed early and understood the emotional effects better so that i could have worked to be more present and loving during our tenure. im scared that she is the one and that i will never find another woman who makes me as happy as she does. i struggle from anxiety in social situations and meeting new people sucks. with j i never felt the need for reassurance, something i had not felt in past relationships. she loved me so much, and now it is just gone.. for someone she recently met. it kills me. i have been dealing with depression recently, i now better understand my emotions and genuinely understand empathy. i am a better person because of these events but i want to be a better person with her! a little bit more background info i am a very smart person, school is easy to me and i am achieving honors at a fairly prestigious university in a tough program. j worked full time as a supervisor at a fast food place, she did not drive and was unsure what to do with her future. i do not know if she was actually the one, or if i will find a better paring later, but right now it certainly feels like i wo not find another woman that makes me happy as she did. has anyone else gone through similar situations, does anyone have advice or help to guide me through these thoughts and to move on with life knowing i will be happy with a new partner later on. tldr unaware of adhd effect on my relationship, girl of my dreams moved on while i attempted to overcome the perceived boredom i felt while together with her. edit i feel like this song explains my feelings pretty well",adhd

100.125656,12.214451,"questions about adderall vs vyvanse. hey guys! i have a few questions regarding adderall and vyvanse. i know the differences between the two chemically and action related, i think i m looking for some input from those who ve been on both. i was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd about months ago. i am currently in mg adderall ir twice daily. i have noticed a few things about how it effects me. it s also worth mentioning that i am notoriously bad at gauging the emotions of others, and even worse at gauging my own. if you were to ask me how i m feeling at any given moment if i m not either angry or happy at that time my answer will be i have no idea. so basically i don t know how i feel at any given time. it makes me worry that i might also have high functioning autism but that s beside the point. what i ve noticed with the adderall is that the first month or so it was working great. i was finally able to focus, sit still at work, and my favorite benefit was that my patience for other people was x better. for a month or so now my patience has dwindled down to just above baseline levels which is still not good. when i was at work and started to feel like people were starting to make pissy i thought it was my medication wearing off. just yesterday i realized that even though i was pissy i still had focus and was able to sit at my desk without taking numerous fake bathroom trips just to get up. so i m thinking now that the adderall is making me moody and irritable, which sucks because those first months i was so patient and it was a great feeling. the reason i m asking about vyvanse is that my girlfriend is on vyvanse and she gave me one of her pills a few days ago so see how it was. it worked almost like my adderall had in the first months. has anybody else been on adderall and stared getting moody on it a few months in and then switched to vyvanse for one reason or another? i spoke to my doctor about this last month, how the adderall wasn t covering my entire shift at work. i was thinking this because of the irritability, but as stated i realized i still had the focus yesterday. when i told him he bumped me up from mg x to mg x and said if it s still not covering me that we will try ritalin type meds next. i m a bit worried about ritalin because i ve read a few studies that suggest that it can negatively effect those receptors in the brain. my girlfriends psych didn t want her on those for that reason.",adhd

-35.09023,92.97066,"reflection on the severe consequences of my drinking, and why i m thankful to leave them behind me as i grow into a healthier person wife mother. hello there, weekend warriors i made a post yesterday singing the praises of sobriety and all the light it brings. i found myself pondering on just how bad my drinking had been, and realized i d never made a list outside my head. so i did, and now i d like to do that here. it feels safe here, i know plenty out there will get it, and if my journey helps others i want to provide it. this may be on the longer side, so please bear with me, friends. this is the first time i ve opened up about these things beyond family and very tight friends... for starters, i f had been into heavy social and home drinking for about years before i quit. hubby m and i just always had done it, it was always around. it had become so ingrained in our lifestyle, down to the social circle for the business we own, we never really noticed when it hadn t become fun and became a problem. my rock bottom started february of , when i received my first owi and spent a night in jail. i had the opportunity for my husband to come get me, but i had the vehicle with the car seats, so off to jail i went. it was miserable and demoralizing. i kept thinking, i m not this person. this isn t right. i m not supposed to be here. i was nursing at the time and by the time i left, sorry to be graphic , my chest was overloaded and so sore i couldn t lift my arms. i sobbed when my husband came to pick me up. several consequences were handed my way, which i fully accept, and unfortunately still have some to work through. but i ll get there. a few months later, our marriage unfolded a number of issues. i ll spare the details because they are deeply personal. so ensue months of heated fights, filled with anger, tears and resentment, and of course, fueled by alcohol. it got to a point in june i was just looking for a way to make it stop. i was so tired of the fighting. remorseful for having it happen in front of our young kids...looking for a way to show my husband i was done talking about the subject and that i couldn t take it anymore, i drunkenly swallowed half a bottle of anti depressants. this is by far the most ignorant thing i have done in my life. my mindset was not suicide or self harm. my drunken motive was a scare tactic, that i could just throw up the pills...god i cringe at myself just typing this. so, after failed attempts to throw my mistake up, i needed to be driven to the er by my husband and kids. walked in the lobby, receptionist called in some code immediately, and i had barely sat down before nurses came to get me. i spent two days in the hospital under psych evaluation and couldn t use the bathroom with the door closed. i was released and i felt such shame and sadness, but still i didn t stop drinking. two weeks later we left for our annual family vacation. most of the time was okay, but midway through we had a blowout fight to where my in laws had to peel us apart and i went to stay with my mother for the night because she lived nearby. i we almost ruined everyone else s vacation, and going back still carries a shadow of that memory for me. how my actions impacted the joy of others. another month went by, and more fights, until another huge blowup that resulted in the police coming, assessing the situation, and determining that my husband would spend some time in jail. he wound up in a fair amount of trouble and was court ordered to months of monitored sobriety. at this point i decided to join him. we were sober from august through october, and it was great. it was the longest either of us had been sober since we could remember, and we could tell things were improving. then the holidays came. and so did the drinks. i ll fast forward through the past year a bit. it was a few more sobriety stints on my part, usually lasting a few weeks. lots more fighting, some property damage around our house. but the whole time this year, we started knowing what the culprit was. we just felt we weren t strong enough to drop it from our lives. it was too easy to make an excuse to drink. so a few months ago, another fight, i left drunk, of course for the gas station to get a pack of cigarettes and a walk to clear my mind. i decided i was still mad, and would stop by the neighborhood tavern. i got hammered. disgustingly hammered. i stumbled home, about two blocks. i very vaguely remember falling and slowly working my way back up to standing. but the next morning, there was a quarter sized scrape below my right eye, and puffiness from fluid buildup. i must have hit pavement. i m lucky i didn t get hurt worse. we began having talks of divorce, because our problems weren t resolving. until we brought up quitting drinking. he was extremely nervous about it, as he hadn t joined me in some of my previous attempts at sobriety. i knew it would help, but i was scared it wouldn t heal our marriage. we re almost a month in now, and every single day has been an improvement. we are now working together to build our communication. we have the patience and clarity to openly discuss things without argument. we ve noticed changes in our physical health, including some weight loss. we ve all but remodeled our master bedroom and closet, including new lighting...i m so proud of us. the uptick in motivation and energy levels is astounding. to anyone wondering if they can really let alcohol go, you can. alcohol does us no favors. it slowly drains the life and light out of us. you don t lose anything by quitting drinking. instead, it opens doors to new possibilities and beautiful self discovery. i know that not drinking is one of the very best things i ve ever done for myself and my family. i don t ever want to jeopardize the happiness and well being of those i love again. there is too much beauty in life to throw away for the sake of a bottle. thank you for joining me here and allowing me to be heard. it means the world. iwndwyt",alcoholism

get fucked up every night. going camping? you gotta get fucked up while camping!! i do not get mean, angry, nasty, or violent. i am mellow. i drink bottles of wine while watching movies or tv, make some dinner at am, and then go to bed. reasons why i am not an alcoholic i have a very good, professional type job with good salary. i went to a top us university and law school and drank as much as i could while attending there, too. i have good performance reviews at work, am a manager is level in a major us corporation with a lot of autonomy, and i get along well with others. i am good at what i do. i do not miss work, but i get to work from home most of the time, so that helps! i do not need to sneak alcohol. i do not need to hide it, i do not drink in the morning, and i have no major withdrawal symptoms if i do not drink other than the previously mentioned sleep problems . i have a doctoral level degree and a good family, parents that are married and love me, and good career. i have never hit rock bottom or anything of the sort. so how can i be an alcoholic? my wife swears that i am, but what does she know? so what if i politely, quietly, watch tv and drink bottles of wine at least nights per week basically whenever i can, which means i do not have to wake up early the next morning. if i am an alcoholic , then clearly i am a high functioning alcoholic, right? or is there really such a thing as a hfa??? it is all confusing. now, here is the rest of the truth. i no longer ever drink and drive but years ago, i got a dwi, and i got one several years before that, too. but i have been out of trouble for years. after law school i did not take a major professional exam bar exam . looking back on it, i am pretty sure i put it off because i knew i had to study a lot, and i wanted to drink instead, so i made up excuses to delay it not take it, and i never have. i have been drinking heavily since age or so. my drinking has increased over the years. ten years ago i would get fucked up every weekend plus whenever i went on vacation. now i drink at least , , or more days a week. i drink everyday when i am on vacation. i drink a lot bottles wine . my wife has argued with me been disappointed with me been angry with me for many years because i drink a lot, so its not good for my family. many relationships, including my first marriage, ended largely due to alcohol. oh, and i have had elevated liver enzymes for several years now, i am moderately fat because of it hey, bottles of wine nights a week, plus a pizza at am adds a few calories, you know? , and i continue to drink because the mental grasp it has on me is huge. been drinking heavily for about years now, so how can i easily just quit? the desire to drink is tremendous. life is not the same without it. tv is not as fun, travel is not as fun, going out is not as fun, movies are not as fun, music is not as interesting, and camping love taking my little boy camping is no fun. so how can alcohol be that bad if i never hit rock bottom and it lets me enjoy things i would not usually enjoy so much music for example. with alcohol i love a good metallica song. without it, i rarely, if ever, listen to music. anyhow, i think you are all thinking that i answered my own question i still drink despite health problems, despite my wife complaining constantly, despite being arrested twice albeit a long time ago , despite not taking an important life career exam which could have led me to be at an even higher level career wise, etc., so i must be an alcoholic, right? but i still do not think i am an alcoholic . for example, if i was told i needed to go into the office at am for the next weeks straight, i probably would not drink. i would hate it, but i would not drink, because i know i would not wake up on time. so how can i be an alcoholic and willingly stop drinking if the situation requires it?

54.31474,-40.92158,"constant anxiety about losing a loved one any advice? i have noticed that lately my most active fear of anxiety is the fear that i will lose a loved one. this is actually something i have had since childhood if my mom was late coming home from work, i would always immediately assume she was in a serious car accident and become inconsolable till she got home. unfortunately, i have not really grown out of that, and it is only become worse lately, since around the time that a family member died after a very quick and sudden battle with cancer two years ago. whenever i ca not reach someone mainly the people i am closest with, my mother and my boyfriend my mind jumps to the worst possible scenario, and i somehow convince myself that it is a rational thought, despite the fact that i go through this thought process almost every day and so far thankfully my fears have not come true and my thoughts have been inaccurate. most recently, i have these thoughts on a near daily basis concerning my boyfriend. he bikes to work, and this is a busy commuting city that is not particularly cyclist friendly. there are bike lanes, but still, each year it seems that at least one or two pedestrians are killed while biking, and others involved in serious accidents. i think he is a good cyclist, but the fear is still really close to the surface. i have him call me when he gets home from work every day, and if he is late, i look for news of cyclist collisions in my area. this morning there actually was a cyclist collision near my boyfriend is house, and sadly, the man died. i read about this when i got home from work and felt sick with worry even though the article stated that the man was believed to be in his s and my boyfriend is in his s till i found out it was not him. i ca not even imagine what the family of this man is going through now. i really do not want to put myself through this this every day. i have my own fear of cycling in this city, which probably makes me view it as unrealistically dangerous, but it is not just the cycling thing. if i do not hear from a loved one when i expect to, my first thought is not their phone probably died or they got tied up with work, it is they were in a terrible accident. when my mind gets fixated on that thought, it is very, very hard to distract myself. does anyone else experience this kind of anxiety?",anxiety

-35.455067,92.705154,"self consciousness is not self awareness! updated most people with social anxiety know what it feels like to be self conscious, and this is probably one of the biggest issues i have personally faced, despite being a rather sociable character. there are two types of self consciousness which are discussed below. private self consciousness is generally not associated with social anxiety, but more often with depression. you examine your internal experiences, in particular those which are not visible to others i.e. thoughts, emotions, sensations, and urges . people who have high levels of private self consciousness often examine themselves, although this may not be helpful because they may become concerned with their inner experiences and become depressed. examples private self consciousness i am constantly overthinking . awareness of oneself overthinking . i struggle to manage my feelings . awareness of oneself having difficulties managing their feelings . public self consciousness is often associated with social anxiety. you are aware of yourself as imagined to be observed by others, and often become preoccupied with aspects of yourself which are visible to others. this is technically known as seeing yourself as a social object . it is often based on a biased perception of how an individual believes they appear to others, rather than how they are actually percieved. those with higher public self consciousness are more sensitive to rejection, because they use the percieved perspective that others have of them to define themselves. in addition, they are more likely to engage in safety behaviours which are designed to reduce negative evaluations and increase approval from others. a final point to make is that public self consciousness is often self fulfilling. if you strongly believe something to be true, then it is more likely to become a reality. for example, if you believe that you are visibly self conscious, then you will often become even more self conscious as a result. if you percieve that to be a negative trait which could cause scrutinization and or rejection, you would become anxious of being self conscious which would naturally perpetuate your overall self consciousness. you are essentially a threat to your own social status, because an aspect of yourself could cause a loss of social status e.g. you come across awkwardly, therefore others reject you . examples public self consciousness i come across awkwardly . awareness of oneself appearing awkward as observed by others . my body language comes across weirdly . awareness of the body langauge of oneself appearing weird as observed by others . i come across as unattractive . awareness of oneself appearing unattractive as observed by others . my nose comes across as big . awareness of the nose of oneself appearing big as observed by others . i come across self consciously . awareness of oneself appearing self consciously as observed by others . my facial expressions reveal my self consciousness . awareness of the facial expressions of oneself appearing as if one is self conscious as observed by others . self awareness moving on to self awareness, this means that you are aware of yourself as yourself . you become directly aware of your internal experiences as a way to gain knowledge of yourself. unlike self consciousness, you have control over yourself and you make use of your knowledge in order to act in a productive way to improve your life based on your values. you are aware of how others percieve you by becoming aware of others, and you use this knowledge to improve your life based on your values. you do not see yourself from the perspective of others. examples self awareness i am aware that i am having the thought i am ugly . awareness of thinking experienced by oneself. i am aware that i am feeling anxious. awareness of feelings experienced by oneself. i am aware that i am experiencing tension. awareness of bodily sensations experienced by oneself. i am aware that i am aware of my body language. awareness of awareness experienced by oneself. i am aware that i am having the urge to eat chocolate. awareness of urges experienced by oneself. i am aware that i am crazy. awareness of the personality of oneself. i am aware that i am bad at socialising. awareness of weaknesses of oneself. i am aware that i am an intelligent person. awareness of the strengths of oneself. i am aware that i value connecting with others. awareness of values of oneself. i am aware that i need to speak more in order to improve my social skills. awareness of the goals of oneself. i am aware that i am currently acting boring . awareness of the personality of oneself in the present moment. i am aware that she does not like me. awareness of how others percieve oneself. how can i be self aware instead of self conscious? mindfulness is a powerful tool used to notice your experience as it is with openness and acceptance in the absence of judgement. practice becoming externally aware of your surroundings both in feared situations and other situations. it is crucial to do this whilst exposing yourself. become aware of your self consciousness instead of trying to get rid of it, and return to being externally aware after acknowledging that you are presently self conscious. this is known as pure awareness. practice taking a few slow deep breaths throughout the day whilst being aware of the bodily sensations induced with each breath. use cognitive defusion strategies such as leaves on the stream in order to separate yourself from your thoughts used in act . those who are naturally more self conscious would especially benefit from turning that into self awareness.",anxiety

20.588467,74.09712,"i feel like the us healthcare system and society in general punishes sick people, especially those with mental illnesses. my journey through anxiety has included therapists, psychiatrists, and a host of other doctors who have placed me on at least different psychiatric medicines. in between moving residences and jobs, attending school, and generally just hitting hard times, i have run out of medication at least times. sometimes i could not get an appointment with a doctor for weeks or months. sometimes i just could not afford an office visit or a refill. and sometimes, i felt so ashamed, tired, and beaten by the whole system. for being crazy. for being too emotional. for being born to a family with serious ocd and mdd going back many generations. for being abused for years. for not learning proper coping mechanisms. for almost flunking out of school and struggling to perform at work. for not pulling myself up by my bootstraps and being a normal, contributing member of society. i tried to convince myself i could will myself out of mental illness, that i do not need expensive doctor is visits or medications. diet, exercise, and meditation help everything, right? self care, self care, self care. sure, you are working hours a week, but it is on you to remember self care . sure, childhood abuse and genetics and all that, but resilience is key. and no surprise, eventually i crash. every single time. because, guess what? it is an illness. one that needs proper treatment. diet and exercise only go so far to treat diabetes and heart disease same for mental illness. but how do we treat people who have an illness in the us? if you have insurance, you are lucky. you only have to worry about premiums, copays, deductibles, out of pocket maximums, making sure your doctor and facility are in network, and all the other convoluted conditions that your insurance company applies. for me, a single person, that averaged about k last year. if you do not have insurance, well. charity, right? charity will take care of you. or medical bankruptcy. or you will be lucky enough to get into a place that has a sliding scale income based fee. what about healthy people? with insurance, preventative screenings should be covered. just make sure it does not become diagnostic, because then you are in for a nice bill. because god forbid you become a sick person. so, here i am. off my meds again because i could not afford to keep paying the copay to see a psychiatrist every month on top of the cost of the pills themselves. slowly crashing. struggling at work. coming in late, calling out sick, performance declining, meetings with boss and pissed off coworkers. i ca not explain to them my mental illness because of the incredible stigma believe it or not, i work in the medical field stigma is rampant . realizing that i need to keep this job, to keep the insurance, to survive. gp wo not write scripts for my meds. so, i call around psychiatrists again. two month wait for everyone in network. there is a psychiatrist shortage, and it is not likely to get better anytime soon because medical schools and professionals have traditionally treated psychiatry as though it is not real medicine . salaries are lower and patient loads are higher. given all of this, it is no wonder we see so many mentally ill people non compliant with their meds, living on the streets, ignored and forgotten. if it is hard enough for me, an insured and employed person with the will to seek treatment, i ca not imagine how hard it is for those less fortunate. if you end up with mental illness bad enough to put you on the street, the hurdles to overcome to get out of that situation are impossibly high. this is what i fear the most just one slip up, just one hospital bill or one lost job away from never getting out.",anxiety

21.082264,73.178856,i watched my dream die right before my eyes and i have never wanted to end my life so badly hi everyone i think something is mentally wrong with me to start. let me tell you what i believe is causing my depression. i have posted here before and here is what i said i feel as if i wasted the best years of my life doing something so dumb i ca not stand life anymore. last summer my group of friends started hanging out with this group of girls and one of them was interested in dating me. i decided not to date her because i was to busy with my business and saw that she was dating a new guy every month and i did not just want to be just another guy. btw she was dating a lot for emotional reasons and not sex when i was a kid i was very lonely and did not have many friends. i was bullied for how i acted and how i looked. i was always pushed around in life and never had the confidence to do anything. when i got into high school i decided to take a stand to this bullshit and started building a business. i worked so hard to build my business and was so obsessed that when something would not go right i would want to end my own life. now at the end of my senior year my business makes about k a year in passive income and i will probably make k a year passively in the next couple of years. this would sound great to the old me and to many others but honestly i feel fucking stupid. since freshman year i dreamed that senior year would be amazing. i would have a beautiful girlfriend and i could take her to homecoming and prom and have the kind of relationship i would see in the movies. my dream was so big but i felt my hard work could make something like this come true. well honestly it did and thats what the problem is. the girl that i decided to pass up over the summer started dating a guy that she continued dating all school year up until today. throughout the school year i had to watch them have the kind of senior year i have always wanted. now that high school is over i feel like a huge failure. i chased money when i had the perfect girl in front of me the whole time who did not care about my money or looks and liked me for me. something much better than anything i could have dreamed of. sadly i had to watch this die in front of my eyes. i ca not believe how stupid i am. i wake up every morning in utter regret for what i have done. each day gets worse as i think about what could have been to the point where i do not want to live anymore. i realized that my depression doesn t have much to do with her. it was the dream i had that i can now never fulfill. i can never take a girl i like to a dance with my friends and have a great time. i can t go to those games with a girl i care about. in fact i can t do anything now because it s over. i feel as if i never had the time i wanted to in high school and i feel as if i failed. i can t move on because i have this need to finish what i started and the fact that this dream is dead i feel as if i have died with it. it s all that mattered to me and now i have nothing besides years of regret. to anyone who comments i know this may sound pointless to you but this was the dream i created and the dream i spent countless hours trying to achieve. all my struggles and successes are in that dream. hopefully you can understand that if you worked as hard as i did and when you reached the moment when all your hard work was about to pay off you missed your chance and all you had to do was just was just say tell someone you like them and the dream would have been complete. i understand that yes she could have broken my heart but at least i would have got some kind of reward but instead i leave empty handed. the money that i earned means nothing without the dream. maybe i am crazy for being so depressed and suicidal for not completing what i wanted but please give your honest opinion. every comment is truly appreciated.,depression

-33.31465,94.639496,"my experience with depression long post recently, i had to write a creative non fiction essay for a class, and i chose to write about my experiences with depression. after having browsed through this subreddit a bit, i figured i would throw it up here hopefully it lets some of you know that you are not alone, and maybe even gives you a little hope that depression does not always last forever. you need to snap out of it. everyone who is depressed has probably heard some variation of this at some point. if you have never struggled with depression, then it may seem perfectly feasible. if you have, you know that simply snapping out of it is about as likely as being hit by a comet falling out of the sky. depression came into my life when i was in high school. like most people, i was a much different person than i am now. i tried to stifle my interests in things that seemed too geeky, i was uncomfortable with myself, pessimistic, less social, and insecure. a lot of it was the ordinary pains of growing up, like any teenager goes through. unfortunately, it started turning into something more. my group of friends appeared to lose any interest in hanging out with me. my brother seemed to think i was entirely worthless. generally, my weekends consisted of hours spent playing xbox perfecting the accuracy of my battle rifle bursts and plasma grenade throws. i did this sometimes because that was what i wanted to do, but more often because it was a way to pass the time alone. i was painfully aware of how pathetic it seemed that this was how i spent weekend after weekend. looking back from a time where i m more comfortable with my inherent geekery, it doesn t sound so bad, but at the time i felt ashamed for being on my own all the time. it seemed like no one was on my side. i had very low self esteem and would beat myself up whenever i talked to someone who wasn t receptive. i found myself unable to connect or relate with many people at school, and as these feelings increased, so did my sense of isolation. it s not socially acceptable to admit you have feelings like this it is socially acceptable to bury them and act like everything s okay. it ended up building up inside of me more than i ever imagined. it was tough to motivate myself to reach out to others when i felt absolutely horrible most of the time. i remember the general feeling and mood far more than i remember specific instances. i distinctly remember what made me realize i was depressed. if the overbearing sense of loneliness, sadness and apathy for several months wasn t a red flag, then other things were. i lost interest in just about everything, withdrew from social contact, and lacked any energy or motivation whatsoever. this type of thing can lead to antisocial behavior, and that s putting it mildly. not only is a social interaction a reminder of how incredibly uninteresting, boring and awkward you are, but it s also a time when you have to mask all these miserable emotions running through your mind and act as if you re mentally stable. because when someone asks how your day is going, they ll be very uncomfortable if you tell them that you spent the morning contemplating how despairingly pointless your life seems. so you don t tell them that, you consciously bury the emotions you re actually having, and tell them you re doing fine. you fumble your way through the conversation and you find you have trouble even focusing on what they re saying because you re too busy thinking about how much you can t wait to get somewhere safe and empty so you can stop faking this smile. what this eventually leads to is just avoiding social interactions whenever possible. this may sound like merely being antisocial and not going to parties, but it goes far beyond that. you don t realize how many friendly encounters you have throughout your day until you find yourself eager to avoid them. for instance, say you re walking home from the bus stop and you see a neighbor, a family friend, stepping out of their car. if you walk past, you know they re going to stop, be friendly, say hi , and ask how the rest of the family is. rather than spend those few moments masking how you re feeling and pretending to care about the conversation, you take another, longer route home, simply to save yourself from that. it may sound selfish to say that you have to pretend to care about anything. but you do, and it s not your fault. when reach that rock bottom where meaningful human connection seems like a luxury reserved for everyone else and your life feels so meaningless and pointless and miserable that you can physically feel the pain in your chest, the simplest of tasks seems like a struggle. looking out for yourself which is something you can t really do anyways is the most energy you can muster on any given day. when sadness pervades over literally every aspect of your life, you can t find yourself really caring at all whether a friend didn t do so well on their math test. people who haven t been through it can have a hard time really understanding what it means to be depressed. it s sadness, it s apathy, it s anxiety, it s hopelessness, it s isolation, it s loneliness, all of these feelings rolled into one horrible, horrible mental condition that sticks with you. the main difference between sadness and depression, in my experience, is that sadness comes and goes relatively quickly. depression makes itself at home within your mind. it settles down, makes itself comfortable, and becomes part of your being. it was a feeling that was constantly there. sure, there d be moments of happiness, but one of the most crushing things was in these moments of warmth and contentment and joy, the thought would cross my mind that soon enough the depression would come swinging back and quickly squash that happiness, making me quickly forget i had ever felt that way. it s knowing that yes, you may feel happy for a few short moments, but thoughts of the bleak, lonely existence of yours will return to the forefront of your consciousness soon enough. if left unchecked, it will consume you and leave nothing but a shell of your former self. i m still thankful i never attempted suicide, or thought about it seriously. but i did entertain the notion on countless occasions. when you feel that terrible, the idea of ending it, somehow or another, sounds heavenly. and by this point, the only way you can imagine it ending sometimes is with death. i had sympathy for victims of suicide before, but now i can t read news articles about these victims without remembering when i was in the same place. it feels like i ve lost a part of me along with them. depression means that the simplest of things can reduce you to an emotional wreck, a ball of tears. maybe it s something you see on facebook, or a song that reminds you of a particularly sad moment, or even something someone says casually that really hits home with you. despite the fact that i can t remember too many specific instances to illustrate the experience, i do remember something someone said that made me want to get home to my room, one of the only safe places i knew, to let it all out. i was at school for an after school event when someone told me you re just an awkward, sad kid there s a million of you. my friends laughed, i forced a smile, but afterwards i struggled to keep a straight face. i stared off into space to avoid making eye contact with anyone, desperately trying to keep my emotions bottled up under the surface. it was just a joke, i knew this to be his type of humor, and i knew there was no malice to the comment. but this was the exact kind of thing i m talking about when a small, harmless off handed comment can suddenly leave you feeling terribly depressed. it cut straight through to all the different insecurities i was feeling. hearing him identify me as the depressed, insecure and worthless individual i viewed myself to be hurt me way more than it should have. once he said that, i ended up counting down the minutes until i could go home, retreat to my room and hide in my bed for the rest of the night. this kind of thing happened painfully often. i can remember hiding in my room for hours on end, a place where i could be alone, honest with my feelings and cry as much as i wanted. i remember those few times when it got really, really bad and i could physically feel pain that i knew was only there because of how emotionally distraught i was. depression makes you feel like you re a burden to everyone who cares about you. at first, venting to someone is like every other time. people who care about you will listen to you and be there for you. you do the same, so you don t feel bad about it. but after a while, you realize that you just want to vent about...everything. you realize that no one wants to hear about how depressed you feel, again, day after day, for no reason other than the fact that the world seems like a tremendously miserable and lonely place. you feel overwhelmingly weak and pathetic, and this tricks you into thinking that you re a burden to everyone who cares for you. thankfully, i was able to recover. i m not really entirely sure how it all happened, but i did change my perspective on a lot of things, and i did slowly gain more meaningful relationships in my life. i can t explain it and i can t claim much credit for it. it didn t feel like a triumphant victory over a mental condition, but more like i had merely survived it. i wasn t suddenly filled with the willpower to overcome it i didn t wake up one day and decide to quit feeling sorry for myself and i didn t simply snap out of it. i know recovering from depression is nowhere near easy, and i know that for many people, it s even more difficult than it was for me. i feel an enormous amount of sympathy for others fighting battles against depression and mental illnesses. it s a little strange thinking back on my experiences with depression from a point in my life where i feel truly happy on any given day. i find myself filled with passion for many of my hobbies, i have relationships in my life that i truly cherish, and i m studying a subject i love. it was a really rough experience and i can t honestly write that i m thankful that it happened to me, but i am grateful for how it influenced who i am. i think for as horrible as this was go through, it was also an opportunity for growth. i know everyone s experiences with mental illness are different. i also acknowledge that when you re depressed, this is literally the last thing running through your mind. maybe it was the depression, maybe it was just growing up, or maybe this is just applying a positive perspective on it all but i know i came out of it a stronger, happier person. it s not that i m never sad anymore. i still cry every now and then, and there are still days that are tough to get through. it s that i can wake up in the morning and feel like my life has a purpose. it s knowing that i am inherently valuable. it s taking pride in my love of gaming rather than being ashamed of it. it s sitting in my room on a friday night with nothing but a book, enjoying peace and contentment entirely on my own. it s feeling completely satisfied simply because i am reading science fiction, walking around town on a sunny day with a friend, learning about philosophy or meeting someone new. it s feeling alive. depression took away so much from me, but somehow or another it left me a better person. for that alone, i am grateful. edit

-35.548542,92.63575,"do not allow others to determine your mental health with today being world mental health day oct th , i am reminded by how much of a colossal struggle just finding the right path towards a healthy mind can be. school can be an absolutely brutal place. witnessing the naive and often unjust ways alpha girls and boys would exercise their power on the more vulnerable kids in the playground was a constant reminder that school was first and foremost a place you had to survive in order to then learn. as the only black kid throughout junior school, and one of perhaps three in secondary, it was important for me not to become fixated upon how i differed from other kids, and instead, look for the things we had in common and could enjoy together. i figured that having friends in various different playground cliques meant there should be less chance of me being seen as an outsider who could not fit in, and so kids should have less of a reason to find beef with me. the more i was accepted into peer groups, the more it confirmed that i was similar to them after all, which led to a sense of belonging and safety, a feeling that seemed important to have in order to get the most out of being in a learning environment. acceptance from fellow pupils became a source of validation and self esteem, which in turn led to having more confidence and a general contentedness. as i grew older and my sense of who i was became more defined, problems started arising. particular groups i wanted be a part of, and thought had things in common with, would not allow me to join and often gave no reason why. the decision to yay or nay my requests resting in the hands of the more domineering kids in the group for whom passing judgement in this way was fun, but for those unfairly condemned it could be a soul crushing experience. there was an obvious flaw in the soundness of my high school survival strategy. was it wise for my sense of well being and self worth to be at the mercy and whims of the other kids? my mental health felt like a commodity on the stock market whose value rose and fell with each acceptance or rejection, reinforcing a hunch the world was just this indifferent and cold arena that rewarded the strong and dominant with the most freedoms. why should membership to desirable peer groups have such a powerful impact on my mental health? i remember being , standing awkwardly in the garden of my friend is parents one bonfire evening. one of blokes who, without any prior conferring, had assembled into a perfect man circle on the lawn the work colleagues of my friend is dad, plus myself. i was shooting the breeze with real men of the world. we were getting to know each other through the mutual exchange of our vast life experience as we flaunted our checked shirts, held cans of fosters to our chests like they were trophies, occasionally glancing behind to scoff at the poor excuse for a fire while we shooed away any giddy child that asked us to play with them. by donning the correct costume, performing the appropriate gestures i would seen other blokes perform, as well as regurgitating stock answers to most of the common ice breaking questions a bloke will ask another fellow bloke he does not yet know, i could tell i was on the verge of entering blokedom proper, and was a hair is breadth away from assuming my position as a functioning member of the privileged patriarchy. after about half an hour or so of trying to assimilate with these learned elders, i noticed there was one main bloke who did the majority of the speaking, and was the default focal point if you did not know what to do with yourself like stand properly, or hold your can of beer with a convincing level of manliness. despite his irritating braggadocio, he was a welcome diversion that deflected group attention away from my poor quality man acting. occasionally he would look over to another bloke, who i concluded was his deputy, for those moments when he needed his more audacious claims backing up. an hour had past, the fosters was flowing and i would gained the ability to hear things beyond the cacophony of anxieties in my head. i felt at ease. i could focus on the actual content of what us guys were sharing with each other, and could think about how i would be able to shoehorn myself into the conversation. so i listened eagerly for an opening in order that i could make my mark. what i heard was a series of banal accomplishments, mainly home improvement based, presented to the group as though they were scientific breakthroughs. disdain was being flung at nearly everyone and everything, designed it seemed, to exemplify their own strengths. their incompetent work colleagues, their illogical and irrational wives they could not understand and regretted marrying, their children who were unaware of what good music was, the idiotic tactics the manager of the football team they supported would use. the weather. modern life. vegetarians. it just went on and on... the best i could manage was a couple double entendres and an innuendo that brought a ripple of chuckles, but it felt completely contrived. i was being a fraud, ticking boxes to gain status. i did consider the possibility that everything they were saying was valid, but for some reason i did not feel like i was in the presence of nobel laureates. at a certain point during the exchange i felt a bit off. waves of disenchantment about what the hell i was doing and what being a man actually involved began swirling around inside. then one of the guys began regaling us all with the time he heroically got out of his car to give a lollipop man a piece of his mind for walking into the road too abruptly... nah, this is shit! i said out loud, fetched my bike and rode home.",depression

86.458145,32.420513,"depression is like getting stuck in black tar. this is a comparison i like to use for my depression. this is something i came up with so it may not be the best comparison but it s how i view it. depression for me is like getting stuck in black tar. in the beginning it s a hot liquid. you can move freely and it hurts a lot but after a while, when you have sunken lower, the tar cools off. now you are stuck in the tar but oddly enough it doesn t hurt anymore. you don t really feel anything. the absence of feeling is a bit worrying. it s better than the heat you felt earlier though. you slowly accept this as your new reality. sometimes you panic a little because you feel stuck but you can t get free on your own. then the sun comes up, someone who offers you love and support. it starts to heat up the tar and you feel it starting to move. at first it s nice but you have spent so long in the cold tar that you forgot the pain of the heat. the sun keeps shining and it hurts again. you want to go back to the cold tar. you don t want this feeling anymore. but the sun keeps shining. the tar is hot but it s finally hot enough that you can move. you can finally get out. sometimes the sun takes a little time. clouds may interfere with its warmth but in the end it always keeps shining. it s not always enough to keep you out of the tar but it will get you out again if you fall in. that s how i view my depression. i ignore my issues because it hurts to keep thinking about them. after a while i start feeling numb and i can t experience extreme emotions or sometimes there is a disturbing lack of happy feelings . i have now learned that someone, who offers me love and support, will bring back those issues full force and instead of ignoring them i have to work through them. it s not easy. i like to push away people who are kind to me. i want to save them from the tar because it feels like an infection. the kinder they are, the hotter the tar gets. it kind of feels like it s getting worse but i just forgot how much these issues bothered me. so feeling that pain again instead of the numbness is a bit jarring. but when i finally get out of that tar , it s always such a relief. right now i am stuck in the tar. i am trying my best to get out though. there s not really a point to this post but i just wanted to share this. i m actually thinking of creating a comic or a set of paintings that tell this story. falling, getting stuck, warmth and pain, getting out it will be a bit scary to post online but i kind of want to do more with my art than just pretty faces. edit thank you all for being so nice. didn t expect people to actually like this analogy. it kinda makes me happy to read the comments.",depression

-40.234283,89.35142,"first time reaching out about depression. help! hi there. i m new here. my name is rj and i m a female college student attempting to reach out and learn more about depression for the first time. i don t really know what i m doing here, but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. some brief history about years ago in the th grade i had a terrible year and felt incredibly sad for about months because of life circumstances beyond my control. my mother sent me to a therapist a few times and she diagnosed me with mild depression, but i don t think a medical note was ever made on it, and i was never medicated. i stopped seeing the therapist not long after and a few months after that, my situation changed and i improved. last year, i felt the first recurrence of depressed feelings for two or three months because of a terrible roommate situation i was in, but the feelings went away again after i was able to change rooms. this year, i have felt more or less depressed since january, without any significant length of time feeling normal happy. there are a lot of reasons why i feel down, but sometimes i feel sad without there being a specific reason. that, combined with the fact that i feel a more intense sadness than i used to, makes me think i have something serious going on. the depressed feeling always starts off for me because of feeling lonely or unloved. i have always been pretty introverted and had trouble making friends, and this year especially i have felt like most of my college friendships are superficial or like i m their second choice, and that has eaten away at me a little bit. i also feel like i might have some anxiety going on because i ve been extremely self conscious in social situations and very afraid of being judged for not having friends or not fitting in. it s kind of scary because i ve never thought of myself as one to be prone to that kind of anxiety. i feel like there are tons of smaller things that get me down on a daily basis, and it is really easy for me right now to just feel like every area of my life is wrong. i ve been trying to find a summer job for over a month now, and yesterday i found out that i didn t get a job that i really felt like i was going to be hired for, and the disappointment was crushing. then today, i forgot one small thing at a friend s house and it was like that was the last straw. neither of those two things should ve upset me as much as they did, but i think they broke the dam of my suppressed emotions, if that makes sense. i ve felt indescribably depressed all day. i barely ate or got out of bed, and took two hour naps. when i wasn t napping, i was watching tv or lost in my own thoughts. i m scaring myself a little. i feel empty and apathetic and sort of hopeless, to a degree that i don t think is logical. i m avoiding friends, nothing seems exciting to me, and even ordinary tasks feel too hard. but i m also having a strangely hard time explaining how i feel to others, like even right now i m struggling. right now, during the summer, it is only my best friend and i in our apartment. we are friends of years so she knows me well and has seen me through these episodes before, but today was straining for us. she noticed how off i was and how i didn t want to get out of bed and was concerned. she tried to talk to me about it and get me to talk about how i feel, but i just couldn t. for some reason, as soon as she tried to ask me about how i was feeling, it s like i stopped being able to speak. like there was some invisible wall separating me from her. there were a lot of long awkward silences, and i could tell that she was sad from my lack of responsiveness. i feel like a terrible friend, and i don t know how to tell her how i feel because i don t even know how i feel. i think she is struggling to understand that i am not always sad for a reason and that sometimes i don t know exactly why i feel the way i do. i think it is frustrating to her that she can t help me and that she can t understand. i feel pretty guilty about it though. i feel like a terrible friend for causing her to worry and be sad for me, and for not being able to be a better friend to her right now. she hasn t left me or anything, and is being as supportive as she can without being able to quite understand, but i still feel guilty for the state i m in, and i also don t want to be a burden to her. i just want to be able to be normal so i can act like a real friend again. sorry this message is so long, but thank you for reading it. this is my first time trying something like this, so any response is appreciated. i guess the things i m really concerned with are what i should do next do i need a clinical diagnosis? should i try to get on medication or go to therapy? how do i do that? what are some things i can start doing right now to help myself or cope? how can i help the situation with my best friend roommate? how can i help her to understand while being a better friend to her? any other general advice and encouragements personal success stories much appreciated. thank you so much.",depression

-40.231083,89.35405,"my depressed wife is leaving me and not depressed for a guy with depression, and she wo not seek treatment. my wife of years, who i have been with for , has a history of untreated depression. that was all she ever really told me about it until later this year when it was already too late. everything was great for the first years. she had bad days sometimes, but nothing frequent. she started a new job a few months before our wedding that turned out to be extremely toxic. the job reinforced bad feelings she had about herself. she always blamed her bad moods on the job, and made excuses for them that i believed. she lost this job a few months after we got married, at which point she started displaying severe symptoms of depression. in hindsight it is so obvious that i should have done something, but i thought that she would be ok when she found a new job. she still did not talk to me about her depression, and i still do not know what i would have done if i had known force her to go to therapy? from what i know now, that is not really possible or healthy. we drank socially and did drugs occasionally, but she started drinking alone more and doing harder drugs socially without me. she started smoking weed alone daily, something i told her i did not like. again, i stupidly thought it was a phase and would end in time. her excuse was that she was not doing these things alone she was drinking and smoking weed while chatting with her online friends while i was at work. months ago, about . years after our wedding, she told me she was not in love with me anymore. after some questioning, she admitted that she had feelings for one of her online friends, who also suffers from depression. she helped him through a recent breakup, and she said he understood her depression in a way that i never did, which is partly because she never talked to me about it. i told her that i wanted her to go to therapy alone and we could go to couples therapy for us to work on our marriage and find out how i can help with her depression. i made her promise to cut contact with this guy during this time. a month later, i found evidence that she never cut communication with him at all, which she confirmed. upset, i told her to move out and figure out what she wanted while she continued her therapy. i found out later that she only went to sessions in total, all with a psychologist that she did not really like. she moved home to live with her parents. again, i thought she was going to therapy at home, but she was not. i believe she depended on the other guy for therapy and support during this time. last week, after months apart and not speaking, she contacted me to tell me that she still thinks we are wrong for each other and that we should get a divorce. i do not think i am being spineless if my wife was not depressed, i would have left her months ago due to her infidelity and unwillingness to work on our marriage. but because of her depression, i am not able to believe that it is really what she wants, and i just ca not give up on her yet. i have been seeing a therapist to help myself deal with this situation and to find out how i can help her. he believes that her depression is driving her destructive choices, and this guy is taking advantage of her and manipulating her in a time of weakness. she does not talk to her friends about any of this at all. i have been in touch with her best friends, and they told me that they think she is making terrible choices and they want her to patch things up with me and get help. i spoke to her a few days ago and she claims she is doing better exercising, starting new hobbies and new jobs but is still not getting treatment for her depression, and still thinks we should divorce but has taken no action to do so yet. she agreed to meet with me in weeks to talk. i feel like it is my last desperate chance to save my marriage, but more realistically, it is probably my chance for closure because i will not be able to change her mind. hearing her tell me it is over is like hearing a stranger tell me that my wife wants to divorce me. i just ca not believe it unless it comes from her, and i feel like she is not herself anymore due to her depression. i know it would be so much easier on me to just give up and let her go. but after all she is done and all this time, i still love her and me, her family, and her friends all believe that she is making the wrong choices for us and for her own mental health using this new guy as a crutch is dangerous, and what happens when they are both depressed at the same time?

39.124382,24.097782,"new prescriptions so probably starting tomorrow, maybe a little later for one, i am going to start taking both a laxative and a stimulant. the stimulant is because i was just diagnosed with adhd and it is supposed to help. stimulants do have an appetite suppressing effect which my doctor and the psychologist i saw are concerned about. the laxative was prescribed by a gastroenterologist. apparently since fiber did not help as he previously suggested laxatives are the next step, but i do not believe that i am constipated. still, there is reason to believe it might help reduce my bloating which may in turn reduce some of my other symptoms. that being said, i am a little worried about combining an appetite suppressant and a laxative. i will likely be eating less and then when i do eat i will be getting rid of everything really quickly. i know laxatives do not actually make you lose fat because everything you eat still gets digested before it is expelled from your body, but it may translate to weight loss on the scale as i will always be pretty empty when i get weighed and i will probably also be a bit dehydrated so less water weight. i figured people here probably have a lot of experience with stuff like this, so it seems a good place to ask. i am a bit worried about both of them being addictive, but also i do not want to lose weight that is not fat and have my doctor get concerned over nothing. she is already concerned that i weighed a little less than before when i had a physical recently so she asked a nurse to weigh me again today when i saw her to get my prescription for the stimulant. i think with all my clothes on i went from lbs to so i am still above my lowest weight, but i am getting close and if i reach my lowest weight she might get worried and make me change prescriptions.",eating_disorder

-32.828766,95.1179,"when suffering is too great i would like to start by saying that, although brief, i would need a million words to encompass the suffering i have endured in the past years. i am currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily, and frequently at that. i have even tried desensitizing to various methods, drowning etc by imagining them in depth. the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love, because my suffering has greatly exceeded it. as you are probably well aware, the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring child is or family suicide is unbearable for them. the grief it would cause my mother, who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great. my problems may seem unbelievable, but i assure you everything i am about to tell you is the truth, not embellished in the slightest. when i was i moved south in the uk to study. during that time i fell ill with mild depression and anxiety. nothing out of sorts, just mills problems. looking back now, it was probably the happiest time of my life. i lived well with other people and managed socially and at university. i worked regularly at health shops and other retail shops. by the third year of my course i had experimented heavily with drugs. this was fine, i was fine. i smoked cannabis regularly and was often in a blissful state at the end of the day, no worries. i fell into homelessness after my degree ended like a daydream or a fever. i had many friends, this was not something to worry about. i relished in this until things became serious. i stayed at multiple people is flats for months on end, supplying them with food to help. i was oblivious to my immediate situation and when the last person i knew and a good year of sofa surfing had ended i was stranded. by the time it had ended, i was only barely aware of the way i had been coping and that was with multiple opiates and cannabis. by the end of this period i had developed pretty severe social anxiety, characterised by sensorimotor ocd and an inability to communicate with new people without being completely aware of my expressions and movements. i had no option of my family helping me already asked for way to much and i turned to the local authorities. i was addicted to painkillers, unable to find a place to stay and lost. i eventually ended up in a hostel, and by all accounts was an absolute godsend. i lived with other temporarily homeless people and began working within the tjx industry. now with relatively few people i knew, i did not learn any of the things a person should try if thru felt depressed, angst or other side. nobody taught my how to cope. i continued opiate abuse and eventually quit my job. i was offered a move on flat by bht a local charity and it turned out to be the worst decision i could possibly have made. i would like to say now that this was bliss compared to what i experience right now. nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental torture that was to come. this next section is something wrote about months ago. i would like you to read this and then i may continue. i will mark the section. my progression from a functioning human being to a total social recluse who is both now chronically physically and mentally unwell was rapid. there will be no exaggeration or embellishment in my writing and everything i say is true. i am glad i have found this place. following my university course, and subsequent mental health issues and drug abuse, i went through anxiety to anxiety, chronic depression to psychosis. none of the things that i just mentioned, while serious, even touch how much i have suffered in the last year of my life due to my living conditions, random illness and unlucky circumstances. i truly did not know what suffering was until this time. a few years after my degree i was not doing to well and i became homeless after i failed to find a house after i was sharing with others. i had a few minor friends that let me stay at their house, but nobody i was especially close to or a base in which i could reclaim my life. at this point i would like to mention, that while i do have family, i rarely have contact with them due to differences. at that point there is no circumstance where i would have been able to live at home. things progressed and i was declared homeless and sought hostels in a housing association in brighton called bht. i worked in retail and paid a portion of my rent and was getting better physically and emotionally and decided it was time to move. bht had a scheme in place where they would help you find somewhere to live and one day when the support workers came over as per usual on wednesday , they laid out in the table what was to be the worst thing that ever happened to me. i was shown an experimental housing project that consisted of shipping containers, much like those used in holland for students. we were provided with artist impressions and it looked very clean. best of all there we no deposits or rent in advance and the full rent was to be covered in full by the local housing benefit. i was immediately interested and began building a portfolio, which was required to sign up and and interview was to be taken. i did all the necessary paperwork and was invited to a group meeting with other tenants who has signed up. when i arrived we were briefed for a couple of hours. we were told about the location, how we would pay electricity etc. i made a good impression an was accepted and all the arrangements were made to move in. this is when it all began. my first experience with the containers was an ugly one. not only were they nothing like the artists impression, they were stuffed in front of a metal scrap yard and a pub which had just been demolished. i later found out that it was because of unsafe chemicals in the earth below the pub. these containers stuck out like a sore thumb and all i could think of when moving in was how much like prison it looked. boy was i right. but i had no right to complain, i had nothing and nowhere to go, this was a lot better than living on the street, or so i thought. about a month after i moved in the antics began. i remember after night of drunks and drug addicts screaming, shouting a fighting courtyard. people smashing up parts of the containers and ripping off postboxes. the front of the containers was a showcase to the road and with both front and back being glass windows the whole piece, with a door . since there was no lock or fob system, people from friday night and saturday night poured in and caused havoc. it is situated just at the end of london road, probably the worst part of the city. there is no gap between the containers, they are all lined up like prison cells and stacked straight in top of each other with corrugated stairs. people would stare and take pictures in the day. and they would mock me and trample around my front door in the evening. nobody is business was their own, if my neighbours were partying, everonr else had to put up with it and the stairs would fill with people jacking up or cracking up. i distinctly remember feeling utterly hopeless and alone one night when a group of men came to the top floor and stood looking at the road from outside my door. they had obviously been on a night out and some were drunk. i remember the words outside my container. if i lived here i would jump of this floor and kill myself and preceded to laugh and joke about what low life is must be here. a year later and things were getting atrocious. violent neighbours and their visiters ran rampage over the whole project. every night was the worse than i could have imagine. screaming, fighting, stabbings, rape and everything in between became normal. people would trash thier whole flats and scatter glass over the courtyard, and throw all of their rubbish in the bit just beside the containers. i would never have been able to dream up this madness. when i mean there were people screaming for hours on end, i mean it literally. residents absolutely off their minds running round naked and shouting at the top of their lungs for hours and hours on end. men assaulting women and there were cases of rape also. people flats were rushed for people seeking revenge for missed drug money. the place was completely out of control and the visits from the police and ambulances were so frequent, every one i heard go by i though was for the containers. this was every day and night, no exception. two people committed suicide. i have had people try my handle i was sleeping, try and break my door down and rush a flat i was speaking to a neighbour in looking to kill or beat to a pulp someone who has nothing to do with me. i had people asking me for money i. a daily basis and the walk up to my flat was hell with residents heckling me and wanting anything and everything from me. i made one friend there who was poet and wanted to help him record. he set up an anxiety talk in his flat for the good residents and we all made our case to the housing association and got many signatures for a petition to help with the project. we had frequent meetings with andy winter the ceo of bht. we all spilled our hearts out about how bad it was living here and how security cameras a gate lock etc needs to be set up. past the unrelenting crime and hellish neighbours was the cold. these containers got cold in the winter and the insulation was awful and the heaters were pathetic little ceramic tiles that did nothing. the electricity was on a meter system and i was spending at least just being warm. bare in mind most of these people got about every two weeks from the job centre. the housing association did nothing for about a year, when they finally implemented wooden insulation. i had a meeting with caroline lucas mp of brighton personally in a food bank i would vistit and she was sympathetic but there was little she could do to help. a few residents practically declared war on bht, and rightly so. they had ruined our lives and now where ignoring our cries for help, because of they did acknowledge the huge failure that the project was they would probably be shut down. i went to numerous newspapers whom ignored me as they were told they were not allowed to publish our stories. the only one which was actually published was only a few weeks after we moved in and was by my neighbour by this point i was struggling badly with mental illness again. i was depressed and highly angst with daily panic attacks. it did not help that the ventilation system was also poorly designed and i receive all of the drug fumes that come form the bottom floors i am at the top . this included ispice now banned in the uk smoke and i went to hospital frequently with chest pains. these fumes filled my flat all day long, so i spent a lot of time walking out of the house. this last year is when the hell occurred. someone moved in next door with severe anger issues. he would break the the flat into little pieces and blast his meter high speakers all day and night filed on speed and weed. i would wake up suddenly in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding, panicking due to sudden slams or smashes against my wall. there is barely any space between the walls. i began to have sleeping problems and insomnia that started worsening everything else. complaints were made to no avail, they tried to evict him bit it did not work and was a lengthy procedure. he was not the problem though, his visitor was. he was another tenant in the project and one that has caused problems before. what started out with a bit of neighbourly chatter tuned out to be the worst mistake of my life. i invited his the other neighbour in to play some video games and while we got along, i stopped inviting him in after it became apparent that he was an absolutely despicable human being. he recently had threatened to beat up a girl that i had to stop and was known to be causing issues, making people feel bad, but was not a major problem around the block. it became clear to me that this man was a secret demon. he began knocking door hard in the morning and after ignoring him for weeks i would eventually answer and tell him i do not want to see him. he would take this as an oppurtunity for an argument and harass me further. he deluded himself into thinking we were friends and became aggressive when i poiletly told him and sinhalese to him that we were not. he thought he could do whatever around and in my flat. he stated trying my handle daily, sometimes even without knocking and this went on for months and months and months. i asked him to stop but he would not. i told him my anxiety and insomnia was getting so bad due him and my other birth our that i am going insane. he carried on trying my handle and door daily, sometimes for hours on end. this was the worst. i shouted at him told him to leave numerous times but it carried on. if you have ever had someone debase you on such a level you will know how damaging that is. someone who dictated when you sleep or wake and knows there is nothing you can do about it because they have nothing to lose and you do. i could not fight him because he would probably take it further. the sound of handles going stated to evoke a horrible physical response, one which would affect me for weeks on end. i could not call the police because that would put me in a dangerous situation for being a isnitch . there was no point in telling my housing association, there is nothing they could have done that would not put me in a worse situation. along with an already desperate situation and a very loud neighbour and another who took it upon himself to make my life a living hell i began to get seriously physically ill. the present day i began suffering with horrible fevers and viruses, symptoms that can only be described as like having the flu for months and months last year and they have not stopped. i had about bloods taken over the course of the year and the doctors ca not figure out why i am the state i am in. when i talk about this i ca not stress enough how much i do not mean this lightly. i have had the nora virus while withdrawing from diazepam and that did not touch the physical suffering i have had every day for the past year. raised cortisol and adrenaline have left me incapacitated and completely ravaged my body, i know all of this stress is to blame. coupled with dreadful hypervigilance and severe insomnia the suffering had been something i would not wish on the most evil person. i began to lost my mind and become so derealised and depresonalized that i do not know how to concentrate or relax. i cant do anything i live like play instruments or listen to music without the content dear that someone might hear and start harassing me. the insomnia has been so bad i have been nearing hospitalization and the only reason i am here today is that i managed to escape for a few months back to a friend in gloucestershire. i have wanted to commit suicide for such a long time, but i never will because of how much it would hurt certain family members, even though i do not have contact with them often. just to be clear, i dont take alcohol or drugs and have not for a long while. i eat a very healthy diet and exercise force myself daily and practice standing medidtation pretty much impossible with the though of him being around for the last months the loud neighbour has been evicted, but the other one the real problem is still around. every time i enter the gate is like the walk of the gauntlet, whether i will see him he is often around and have to deal with him. having gone to my friends house in gloucestershire i got back to find out i could not get back in because someone had tried to break in and snapped something in my lock. i am completely aggrophobic. i never see anyone than people at the supermarket and when i enter the gate i practically run up to my flat, stuff the curtains with cloths so they ca not see the lights when i have them on a night and make barely any noise at night. someone else has moved in and the evil man has started going into his flat talking to him. i ca not believe that that after a horribly loud neighbour who attached the evil man i am the first place has now been evicted, the next one is also inviting him up and will probably soon give the man a reason to start knocking me again under the guise of friendship. i know he is around because i hear him shouting laughing outside my flat and i know he has knocked me once or twice in the last week. just after christmas, i did everything i could to move to a different county. i found the only place that i had a possibility of moving to was bournemouth and an agency called dwp housing, due to their low fees and no deposit. i got a citizen is card and went there took the form in and they accepted my referencing. i was invited to view a flat when i received a call from the wan i was dealing with saying they would not be corresponding with me any further. i found out that my housing association had been talking with her and told her i was in rent arrears, which i was not. i was in water debt and service charge with confused her. but she did not ask me before sending the emails and ruined my chances. i have been to the council, the waiting list is unbelievably long, even with medical needs. everywhere else i have been wants in fees deposit which i currently have no way of saving. because of living in a hostel even though i am i am now entitled to the one bed rate of any country, unless i move into shared, in which case that privilege will be revoked. at this point i do not care where i go, i would happily take anywhere else in the country, whether it be a hostel or otherwise. every day is a battle to keeping on going and i have no one sleds to talk to. that is was what i wrote a while ago in a forum dealing with neighbours. following the containers, i was able to get a loan and finally move out of them for good. i move to another part of the country, completely on my own, did not know anyone at all. i since have developed a depersonlization disorder following the end of the containers. i became so detached, i may have walked on separate occasions for odd miles a day for months. it occurred one night last christmas when i returned from a visit to my family is house. it is an absolute miracle that i was able to leave, and i was so optimistic that i began doing everything in my power to make myself well. i eat a perfect diet, i exercise daily and do everything i can. the chronic insomnia stayed and the dissociative symptoms have reached a point where my awareness levels are very worrying and borderline insane. i spend whole days trying to take on various stimulus took regain awareness. i try to take in sounds a sights, but everything has lost meaning. i ca not appreciate a beautiful lake or a song, because i am not here or there, i am nowhere. i feel like some sort of blood supply has been cut to important regions of my mind that i can only beg for help about. the fevers randomly come and go, even away from the containers and most days i wake up feeling physically awful. i cannot control my body temperature and wake up, i feel flu like again and again, which is how it began before. my muscles ache unbearably all day, i have to walk slow and when i exercise i do it out of fear of death. my body is simply fucked and no doctor can explain it. i clearly have something wrong but it ca not be explained, probably because it is so complex or a virus so deep, it ca not even be found. i have had over blood tests in the last year. around two weeks ago i developed a very loud tuning in my ears. it is severe tinnitus that is making everything i do meaningless. the last thing that i had in the world after moving was peace and quiet at night and that had been taken from me. there is no sight of it going and it did not follow acoustic trauma. i can see myself rapidly declining in the past few weeks. this is becoming a joke. i have begun to think that this is some sort of test. i am being referred to a new psychiatrist,a sleep clinic and the community psychiatric team in my area and hopefully a neurologist. i now have no friends and speak to family maybe once a month. i exist only because i do not want to hurt those who may feel pain from my death. i love my year old grandmother too much to burden her in her last year is and my mother would be distraught. i am approaching a stage where my suffering is so great, that there would have been numerous times that if i would had access to a gun, i would definitely would have killed myself. the fear of drowning, hanging or falling is great. i want to die, i want others to accept that i want to die. i have been looking into possible euthanasia. i am close to the end. if you have read that all, i thank you that is all i ask.",suicidality
