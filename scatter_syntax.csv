93.703415,-37.75291,"my story.. it is very long.. hello everyone. i have been visting this site a lot for the last few months. i am a year old male. i smoked occasionally in high school just on weekends and enjoyed it a ton, never had a problem with it kept my use under control. last summer after i graduated i become good friends with two guys i knew from high school. i started smoking with them quite a bit, and by then end of the summer i was smoking daily, usually multiple times per day. i started working full time last fall and that is when i became really dependent on weed. i would smoke when i woke up, before work, and after work. on my days off i would smoke all day.. grams at the minimum usually. i put off going to college, due to lack of motivation. i ended up signing up for community college and started in january . after a month of college i would skip my classes a few times a week. why? so i could get high and ignore my respnsibilites. i ended up failing of my classes. by spring of i started to realize i had a problem. i would buy weed before i even ran out. i would spend my money on weed rather than stuff i needed. i knew i had a problem but i kept smoking. from september july i smoked at minimum a half oz. every week. probably spent on weed monthly. when i did not have money i would get desperate and pawn things, at times i even stole money from family, something i deeply regret, even though i never got caught stealing. i felt like i could not go a day without smoking. being sober for a day was extremely boring for me and depressing. the only thing on my mind every day was making sure i would be able to get high a few times that day. in june of i decided that if i am going to keep smoking, i need to stop spending the money i work for on weed. i wanted to start saving money, but never could cause any extra money i had would go towards weed. so, i decided to start selling. just a few days after i started selling i accidently left my facebook up on my dads laptop. my parents seen messages of people asking to buy weed from me. they called me and were very mad and dissapointed. they threatened to kick me out, but i promised them i would change. i was sober for a couple days after that incident, but of course i fell back into my ways. for the rest of june and july i smoked an ounce every days. at this point i would get high for about minutes and then start coming down. i was smoking to feel normal. i barely enjoyed it, rarely would even smile or laugh while i was high unless i smoked a lot at once. instead of hanging out with friends smoking, i would smoke alone, or smoke with them and then go home to be by myself. i could not make it a day without smoking. it was on my mind . near the end of july i had enough. i came home late at night one night and for some reason my mom was still up, and my eyes were beat red and i reeked. she knew i was stoned. i knew i had to change. on july , i quit. the first two weeks were absolute hell. i started drinking almost daily to replace my heaving smoking habit. by august i was so depressed i contemplated suicide many times. i did not anything at all sober. i felt i had no purpose. on august i was either going to drive of a bridge or get help. luckily, i choose to go to the hospital. i was addmited to a mental health hospital and was there for days. at this point i was days sober. i had been on a depression medication since i was , and at that mental hospital they had me start two new depression meds that were stronger. once i got out of the hospital i told myself i would never smoke again and would not drink for at least a month. from september was drinking daily getting very drunk every time . september i decided to stop drinking. i did. but i started smoking again, daily, times a day. from september to november i smoked every single day. i was smoking more than i ever had before.. a quad g every two days usually. all my money was going to weed. last friday the th i smoked for my last time, hopefully ever. i realized i am never going to get anywhere by smoking. i am in debt from smoking. the fucked up thing is that i have been making every two weeks since june. i have had enough. the last days have been the hardest of my life. i have no appetite, ca not sleep, and do not enjoy anything. but i am not giving in. i get very intense cravings, and when i do i remind myself that getting is a temporary fix for a major problem, and that getting high will only help for an hour or so. if you are going through hell, keep going. it fucking sucks, i know how many of you feel. my advice is to exercise as much as possible. try doing new things. i am very depressed, but i know its a phase. in a few months i will be myself again. believe in yourself and do not talk bad about yourself. the past is the past, you ca not change it. if you wanna quit do it now. do not settle for one last smoke , that is just going to make it harder to quit. also, i highly recommend seeing a counselour or therapist. you can do it! the benefits of soberity greatly outweigh the benefits of smoking daily, especially in the longrun. thanks, hope everyone has a great sober day.",addiction

93.79039,-37.592876,"day and my story right, i am gonna try to not make this too long but i might not succeed, so apologies for the potential text wall. i am and have smoked for the past years, and almost every single day for the past . sometime before nye my dealer made brownies and gave me one to try out, however i never had a day where i had nothing to do so could just wake n bake it and veg the rest of the day, so i ended up eating it exactly on the st of jan since it was clearly going to be a wasted day what with being hungover from nye. the trip i had was like no other, it was the introspective, terrifying psychedelic trip i always wished for but never got on shrooms cid. literally waves after waves of realizations started hitting me how i would done absolutely nothing the past years, how antisocial i would become and the level of social anxiety that weed had created in me, i hugged my dogs and cried when i realized that for all the love i thought i had for them, i would been spending no more than mins day with them even though i work from home, all i did was work hours, get tilted annoyed then smoke and watch tv shows or other shit, basically sitting at my desk hrs day with my back to these creatures who love me unconditionally and are ecstatic whenever i pet them or show them the smallest amount of attention love. i realized i only have a handful of friends because i never want to go out, i do not enjoy socializing although i do enjoy socializing and i do enjoy people . i realized i had no idea who i was anymore, that the old me, the real me is someone i have not seen in so many years. i realized weed was the concern in my life always, it was my biggest monthly expense by far and not having weed in the house made me anxious and think only about how and when i could go out and get some more. i realized i had days where i had to my name and i would go out and spend on weed and on beer to drink with the weed. i...realized so many things about myself that i did not like, but the most terrifying part of the experience came when i looked in the mirror. i would heard stories myths of how you can lose your mind if you look in the mirror on acid but i would done that and it was fine, actually interesting fun. this day however, things were different. i looked into my eyes and saw nothing, just blackness, i did not recognize myself and i felt like i was being sucked into the darkness in my eyes. i turned away and went to the other room to change the setting, which is when i felt a force , i ca not explain it really, sort of telepathically pushing me to jump from the balcony. i instantly had to sit down because it took all my energy to do battle with my mind and regain control of it. it only lasted for a few maybe seconds but it was the most terrifying experience of my life and i instantly knew i needed to quit, for good. i still had some vaped leftovers which i used for a bedtime joint on the next couple of days, then smoked half of a proper joint with a friend while telling him this story. i felt ashamed of myself, very ashamed, but i knew i had to tell at least one real life friend what had happened to me in order to sort of make it real b c one of the things i would realized is none of my friends knew anything about the way i was living, sure they knew i smoked but not how much, not how much i was procrastinating nor the difficulties depression i was dealing with b c i hated my job and i hated the fact that i never did anything. that was the last joint i smoked and compared to all the other times i said i would quit then went back to weed the next day, this time i have not felt the need for it even once. sure, the insomnia is there, in full blast, but so are the vivid dreams, my will to live is slowly coming back and i can already notice a change in my personality. i would gotten sick of not being curious about things anymore, not reading anything, of having intelectual discussions with my friends but not being to express myself properly, stuttering b c of being stoned cotton mouth, basically being dumb. a friend pointed me to this subreddit and it is already helped a lot to read others stories and find strength in knowing other people are right where i am and got fucked by smoking in the same ways that i did or in different ways, too . there is so many more things i could say about how weed negatively impacted my life but what i am most focused on now is how happy i already am to not be smoking and to know that in time i am going to be myself again, not have this mental fog, not lack energy and motivation and have so much more time money to do things i actually like, to socialize more, to actually not be super fucking awkward around women, and basically to not be a high zombie coasting through life moving from one high to the next. to all of you posting here thank you for sharing your stories, i am sure they have helped a lot of people just as much or more than they have already helped me. and i can only hope my story helps at least one person in even the slightest way. we can all do this and we are going to be better people for it, so much better. peace",addiction
94.81315,-35.462032,"i am quitting. i let my habit go way too far. i am days out, and i feel good. i am certain this is the right choiceand need to keep telling myself that. here is my story. hi r leaves. occasional reader, first time poster. sorry for the novel. i am a few days in to quitting, and i actually feel pretty great. but the cravings and justifications are coming hard and fast since it is friday and i have had a ridiculous week at work. but i am not going to pick up tonight, not this weekend i think i need to put it away for a good long while. it started out a couple years ago when a former friend re introduced me to mj. i would smoked a handful of joints in high school and college, but i never really had it around and so it was never a regular thing. not even a weekly thing. but she was a colleague with nearly the same job as i have in research, so it was easy to justify using with her and her friends because she seemed to be able to handle it just fine, and at least outwardly, we are very similar people. she had a dealer with some very kind buds probably exaggerated because i had no tolerance yet and it was great for a few months. i did not smoke every day, and one or two hits around pm was plenty enough to let my mind stretch out and relax for the rest of the night. it was nice. did not see what the big deal was at all. eventually, my evening routine became get home, take a piss, turn on tv, fire up reddit, pack a bowl, lather, rinse, repeat. i would basically head straight for the stash upon hanging my coat up. over the months following, i started accumulating paraphernalia and keeping a larger stash of my own as i justified my now daily habit and my tolerance was increasing rapidly. i admonished myself to not smoke in the morning for about a year, but eventually could not resist and fairly quickly got to where i was smoking one bowl in the morning, and in the evening, every day. it would be about a half ounce every weeks. nowhere near the quantities i have seen some people report on here and r trees, and not a crippling expense for me i have a respectable job with a good income. i thought i was a functional stoner. and i was fine with that for the better part of two years. this ca not continue though. my social life is suffering badly, and i have been horribly isolated and depressed this year. i want to get out, explore my city, be social and outgoing and date more and things like that, but the couch lock wins out nearly every. single. day. until last week, more than hours without weed would make me shaky, nervous, really irritable and unable to eat anything without getting sick, and that is been causing me extreme anxiety because, frankly, okc is working really well for me and i would actually like to be able to go on these dates without having to get a little high first so that i can eat and be comfortable socially. on a few occasions, i have put myself at risk so that i can have access to mj without first coming home after work. plus it is not fair to the women i am interested in it is not like i advertise the fact i am a daily user and i am sure most of them would find it a pretty big turnoff. i know this sub does not favor tapering strategies, and i definitely understand why most people are not able to go that route successfully. but the stomach upset and the anxiety about getting sick at inopportune times did not allow me to go full cold turkey. so a couple weeks ago i began restricting myself to no smoking before , then before , and getting my number of evening bowls down to one. after a few days, just a couple hits kept the stomach upsets at bay and i was able to taper down to half a bowl in the evening. then after a couple more days i replaced the weed with melatonin to help me sleep. my first day without a hit in the morning was days ago, and i have not had weed at all in hours. i cooked a steak dinner last night and enjoyed it all without taking a single hit. i know that does not sound like much, but it feels like an accomplishment and it alleviates a lot of my anxiety to feel like i can eat a full evening meal now without getting sick. i gave away my stash and hand pipe and i am in the process of giving away my bong. the withdrawal feels really manageable today and i feel upbeat about pushing through and completely doing without now. based on my own experiences, i no longer believe claims that mj is not addictive.. like alcohol, some people can moderate and handle it fine. i guess i am just not one of them. so i am a few days out, and feel a

towards the end last months i estimate? she had massive mobility issues, massive pain issues, it was horrible. the docs pretty much did not cap her pain meds at that point, but still you and i both know what high doses of opiates do. i had a friend who was always the resident stoner since hs. i detest that term now, he was a godsend. he got us weed to give to mom, and for days she did not have pain she did not talk, but she could nod her head and mostly understand us . i had tried weed a couple of times in my life i would maybe indulge times a year and never had negative effects, they were always pleasant. my sister has, as part of her issues, severe asthma. at the time, she had the most raging barking cough. he encouraged her to vape some of the oil. within about hour, she said she had felt better for the first time in over a year. her cough stopped for a few hours. of course, i tried some too. i just felt better. one thing you should know about me, is i have always been a guy to get himself worked up big time. my father died about years ago, and my family told me i looked like i was going to fall apart. at that point, i had started paxil doctor prescribed and i have been on it since. it has and still helps me tremendously. but it was not doing much for the sheer anxiety i was having with mom and her issues. any of you who have ever dealt with a family member with alzheimer is know what i am talking about. my anxiety was through the roof. i was taking an ativan every day, and sort of helped, but i would feel even more drained. so, i tried the weed my friend offered. it took the edge off. it was amazing to feel human again instead of a completely wrecked bundle of nerves that would cry seeing what my mother had turned into. during this time, our uncle mom is brother passed of cancer. sad to say, but we did not have a lot of love for him i cut ties with him, but my sister was his poa while alive and executrix after he passed . dealing with a house to clean out his finances still trying to sell his house was a new unfounded source of stress. inevitably, mom passed. my sister and i were facing a new frontier it is very strange when a parent you live with dies, but when they are so very sick mentally and physically there is almost a guilt that you were not able to do anything for them and it is actually still hard to write this, just over a year since she is passed . there were new stresses of course with dealing with inheriting the house and such that we were living in as well as now her finances. both of us continued to vape we actually only tried the buds once, it is always been buying the oil carts and using those . she vapes for pain and to keep herself off the harder stuff which of course, docs will prescribe which she knows is bad for her. i will not begrudge her vaping, and i will continue to try to help her get it. as far as me... i very happily would vape when i came home from work. i would make dinner, and then i would sit and either watch tv or youtube. i would vape myself into oblivion, i wanted to get high. it felt so good to detach and laugh and just feel happy. unfortunately, like many things, a year later the outfit we got it from seems to have done. so we went into conversation mode with what we had left. i would take maybe a puff at night after working out. maybe one before bed. i would mostly leave it for her. i found it still cut my anxiety without going overboard. i also found myself actually doing some small things again. i went on a marathon of cleaning the kitchen floor and carpets. i feel ever so slightly more alert again. i do feel that weird anxiety at times, especially before i go to work. i try to suppress it as best i can, normally by the time i get to work and read my email and see that the planet has not blown up overnight, i am good. before you say talk to your doc my doc is a very open and understanding man. he is been my doctor for years and he was also mom is doc. however, marijuana is not legal in our state, it only is legal for medical and incredibly restrictive mom was supposed to get a card, but died before she was able to. i do not know if i am ready to add a new script that who knows what the fuck it is going to do to me, and how it is going to leave me. so i ask you. i am torn. i am happy with the anxiety reduction when taking it, but i feel i am really cheating myself somehow almost like i am taking the easy way out by medicating myself. maybe the notion of helping yourself and feeling guilty about it is silly, i do not know. totally quit, or continue with a low dose to cut the anxiety?",addiction

99.61998,-16.313726,"i started to build a life without drugs, and then the universe started building right alongside me. hi, i thought that my story might help any of you out there currently struggling with their addiction. this is the ongoing story of me coming full circle to finally start rebuilding my life. this story is pretty long, if you want to skip my history, scope out the last couple paragraphs. that is when the magic started to manifest it self. i hope this helps someone who feels like their life is irredeemable. i started writing down in a journal my struggle with addiction back in when i was hooked on mdpv. i struggled for so long by myself, i kept my addiction hidden in plain sight, but that only works for a short time as we all know. reach out to anyone you can confide in, or find people on here. i just want to let those suffering in isolation, you are not alone. x b this has been a long and dangerous trip, as you all know. i have been an addict for over , but my life took a turn for the worst and perhaps best about years ago. i was an intense iv user of both heroin and meth, took my first oc and adderal at . i was completely out of control, and jail served as my institution. without going into much detail i plead guilty to a felony with potential for violence and at that point in my life i knew my life was over. all my hopes and dreams of ever graduating from college, all the guilt and shame i brought to my family made me use even more in desperation to escape from myself. i had never been in trouble prior to this, and spent a few months in jail before bailing out. x b i delayed my case for almost entire years. within an hour of being released on bail i was getting drunk, by hour i was snorting lines of meth and by week i was physically addicted to heroin once again. i no longer stole for my habit, but as a result of what i did for my habit meant that i had way more drugs on hand then i ever had before. i began to use obscene amounts of crystal, shooting up times a day and at least another half a dozen for the heroin. i wanted to die, i may not have been conscious of it but i clearly had loss any sense of who i was. or what i was, i considered myself subhuman. this continued until for the first time i attempted to get treatment only to influence my eventual sentencing date. i tried outpatient for months and then suboxone but i was not trying. i would go days max on suboxone before going back to using heroin and meth. i was then sentenced, and only had about months left to serve. x b once again, i thought i was the smartest human to ever walk the earth. i somehow knew the inner working of a government agency i had never dealt with. i was gonna beat probation, they ca not tell me to not use drugs. my probation officer on the first meeting said she would be visiting me soon. no way, i knew it would not happen for months, that is what my friends in jail told me. she was a fair probation officer, she more or less gave me strikes in a span of less then days. so they took me out the back into a van and back to jail i go. i had barely been out more then weeks and i violated my felony probation. i seemed to think that i would only get days for my first violation. x b i was dead wrong. probation recommended they send me to prison, and the judge never disagrees with probation on matters such as mine. i was fucked, so i threw money at the problem. money has this magical ability in the legal system to work wonders sometimes. the judge agreed to let me go to a year of inpatient rehab, but on the terms that i get a joint suspension for the mid term. the judge expected me to fail, my lawyer told me to not take the deal. i would serve years if i ever violated probation again. i decided i would take my own life over spending years in prison, but for starters come hell or high water i was stuck at this rehab. x b the salvation army means well as a whole in my opinion, but i had quite a few problems with their program. i almost got restarted to day because i smoked a cig out back while working in the kitchen at am. this place does not fuck around is what i am trying to convey. i had to work hours a week, but this entire process overall was great for me. i really did try to embrace sobriety, but the problem was that i knew i was going to get high at some point. just not there. i moved to their sober living after months, and i completed my year of treatment. i actually stayed at the sober living past my court ordered date, but once there i was able to order u and things like that, that did not show up on tests. except for the jwh i smoked, so i got kicked out of the sober living, and of course they told my probation officer even though i was there by choice. i was working a full time job with benefits. x b i was terrified but as a result of my joint suspension i was put on high risk probation for people released from prison. the lady in charge knew the stakes at hand and she told me i had one last chance. i spent the next years gaming the probation system, i went from twice a week testing to then once a week, then once every weeks, then once a month. during this time i lied to a doctor and got a pill xanax script banking on probation not bothering to ever ask for the script again. they never did, so i began to abuse xanax powder, taking mg or more throughout the day by the end. i also would smoke fent and all the different analogs the second i got back into my car. naturally i one day blacked out at work while smoking it, so now my job started to think something was up. fent became hard to find online, so i started timing my drug test dates, where i would use for sometimes or days and then kick for days before my test. i would leave my house at am every weekend and holiday so probation could not ever surprise me again. i eventually in a rush on my lunch break did a huge shot while driving back to work, except this time i used someone i met at the rehab. it was cut with fent, and i blacked out as i was driving back to work. i somehow pulled into the alley a street down from my work and proceeded to pass out. i do not know how close i was to dying but it took about an hour before someone walked by and saw needles out in the open. i woke up in the hospital. months before that i overdosed on u , they had to administer narcan to bring me back. i was going to end up dying soon if i did not do something. x b i craved stability in my life, it had been so chaotic for so long. so i made the first decision of my life regarding treatment. i decided to try and roll the dice one last time with probation, since at this point i was more then through and i only had to report to a kiosk machine. i enrolled myself in the methadone clinic with about months left on my probation. if probation had found out i was on methadone, i do not know what would have happened, but around here only a dirty test for opiates will get you in the clinic. at the same time i went back to court to try and terminate my probation early. i had to wait weeks for them to write a report, and i was still using heroin occasionally but nothing like before. as a rule of thumb i tended to try and be away from my house during working hours, assuming they would come back. the one day i carpooled with a friend, he had a doctors appointment he forgot, so i had to wait at the clinic for minutes extra. he was driving me back around am, and he goes oh shit probation at your pad. i saw officers outside, i had to make a split decision. i took flight, i said book it and so we drove by. it was only by chance that i had driven by exactly when i did, and when i eventually returned home i found an orange needle cap under a magazine. i would have left in cuffs.the next week i went to court, and probation said i was in compliance except that i had only made small payments on my court fees. by a stroke of luck when i had originally put myself on calendar, the original judge who oversaw my court ordered rehab was filling in for someone that day. i was able to be put in her special court on another floor. she had sprung the original trap for me, but she also saw that i had done what she asked. she approved my motion, and took off every single administrative and probation related fee. i had owed over , but now with only true restitution , i had less then due and paid that off instantly. my lawyer said he had never seen anything like it, that was the day that i knew i was done. i felt it in my heart and soul that i never wanted to do meth or heroin again. period. my last use had been mid june. x b i was on mg of methadone at the end of february, so i questioned if this was a result of the methadone. i decided that i had spent more then enough time under the influence of drugs, so i tried to detox as quickly as they would let me i did mg a week, the doctor wanted of my total a month . during this time, i also began to taper from c lam, which was slow but painless for the most part as i was already in slight opiate wd. i stopped the c lam once i hit mg. i waited weeks at mg, and i still felt i no longer had the desire to use. my last use had been almost months at that point. i decided to take the plunge and just stop. i had to know if this feeling was true, no matter how much pain i would have to endure. it was pretty damn rough, i managed it with some a modest amount of kratom, a decent amount of a disso and the c lam. i would never recommend anyone just stopping like that, i felt almost psychotic on day but then i got my first real sleep in days. it was dying off by day and by day i had already started running. so here i am, days clear of methadone and months with heroin meth or any of that junk. i believe everything happens for a reason. a few days ago i took some lsd that i had ordered, it had been years since i tripped because i was constantly depressed for the last years. i had tried to get jobs throughout the period after i left my full time job to medically detox from xanax over a year ago, but anytime a background check was run, i was instantly out. i was frustrated, and in order to expunge my record, i need a couple thousand to do it properly. i decided to make a post on on craigslist recovering addict looking for a second chance i have made mistakes, we all have in our lives. i am a male. i went completed an month treatment at a clinic and have had months sobriety under my belt. my mistake currently hinders my job prospects until i get it expunged. i have really worked hard to get here, but i am struggling to find a job. the back ground check never gets my foot in the door. if anyone can help, or point me in the right direction, or just send me some good vibes it would be much appreciated. x b x b you know i was super positive as a result of the acid, i just hoped somewhere out there could maybe help me out. i wanted to work, i needed it. i had emails that i think were scams, but then i got one last email. he simply said, do you have transportation and a phone? i replied back right away, and promptly gave him my number. when we talked over the phone, he explained to me that he owns his own handy man job, and he keeps it simple. i may be the last apprentice of his before he retires. he also goes to aa meetings, and has been for years, telling me that he believes in second chances for people and that he had trained his previous works for years, both being former addicts. i was in a state of cosmic shock. x b i had really connected to the exact person i needed at the exact point in my life. the job is low stress, he will teach me everything to the work. to top it off because i expressed interest in operating a business, he is going to teach me that entire side as well. he pays me well for having zero experience, and i can finally go back to college to get my aa, i have been credits or so away from my degree in cs. x b on the flip side, he explained to me how he found me. he said that his last worker had just gotten his license reinstated and so he went back to other work. so that day he is looking around for handymen on different websites, but is coming up short. on a whim, and he said he never tends to do this, but he left an open search in the resume section. my post was right at the top, and once he saw the title and read it he decided to reach out to me. i am still in awe while i was this universe work within it self. words cannot describe how happy and grateful i am. x b i never thought i would make it here my friends. i am still suffering from mild paws and what not, but i will deal with it as it comes. i just wanted to post this to inspire hope in all of you, you can think your the worst of the worst, that you will never be given the chance to crawl back even if you tried. have faith in the good of humanity, there are good people out there in this world. i had given up on everything, i use to write about how angry that i had the burden of a family who loved me so i could not take my own life. this feels like the first chapter of my actual life. stay strong all of you, never give up hope, never surrender. fight this battle til you win, because the universe is

98.32342,-19.711323,"my years roundup this is a really long post, so i do not expect many to read it, but going into a new year i think it is important to summarise the key points of in writing so i do not forget. so, was the year i decided to quit determined to do so and i would accept no failure! alcohol had controlled the last few years of my life at this point and i was close to rock bottom unless i did something drastic. i was drinking at least ml beers a night and i worked from home in a dead end job, had gained a tonne of weight, lost all my friends and could see my end. it has not quite worked out how i wanted, but compared to has been a hell of a lot better. january started with a clean flat, binned all traces of alcohol, filled up my fridge and cupboards with healthy non junk food and went for it. my plan was to exercise, eat healthy and focus on my wellbeing if i crave a healthy body there is no way i can drink after all! i downloaded my fitness pal and signed up to fitness forums for tips. i also entered a tennis tournament handicapped based on ability which took place throughout january to ensure i had a good short term incentive to stay clean. the first day was easy due to my enthusiasm for change the next weeks were very difficult, but by week i could honestly say i didn t crave alcohol. i had to changes my plan a bit i was less strict on the healthy eating and added in a good amount of chocolate in the evening to satisfy cravings which certainly helped. i was overworking myself in the gym so started going to the driving range some evenings as well to ensure i always had something to do and left gym gold as late as possible to ensure as little time alone as possible. i also began reading to take away from the fact i was going to bed sober. this was difficult to begin as i could barely focus on a book and had issues remembering plot lines but by week i was reading a couple hours a night and thoroughly enjoying it. days the tennis final. somehow i had managed weeks, not a drop of alcohol, i had lost weight eaten healthily and my fitness had improved tenfold in such a short space of time. against the odds i actually won this final and felt great. the trophy in my hands was a physical symbol of my success against alcohol and nothing would knock me down. but then i was offered a drink. i did not want a drink, the thought of the drink repulsed me, even the first couple of sips were rancid and i couldn t believe i used to drink so much of the stuff. not sure why i accepted, but i thought it would be nice to try casual drinking again. i had one pint, then another, then i bought more on the way home, then i went out again to buy more. then the next day i felt like shit so repeated the cycle. so i failed, i only managed days and was right back to square one, but i had learned that it was possible. my health was better just from that one month and i knew now that i had more control than i thought i had previously. it should have been so easy to just get my act together from that day and start over but for some reason i couldn t. i drank most of february but had another shot in march to much the same success, i think this time i managed a full days before i had a similar misjudgement and was offered a drink and thought to myself this time will be different well, it wasn t! since then i have tried again and again and failed every time, but during the course of this year, and my constant restarts i have ended up drinking a lot less than last year, from march to august i had bad luck, i would quit for a week or two, relapse for a month, the same story every single time i thought of all this time as serious failures but looking back now, i am happy for those weeks in between and i have managed to build myself up through these periods. in september i was sober enough to start applying for jobs! i thought this would be a turning point and everything would change but it didn t. i was nervous so i drank heavily the night before my first interview i turned up so hungover i could not read the newspaper and almost had a panic attack, but luckily i had the knowledge they needed and managed to bullshit my way through the interview i m good at that and they offered me a second interview in a weeks time. perfect, i ll stay sober for the next week and ace it or not. again i drank the night before and turned up hungover less so this time though. due to my knowledge and enthusiasm i managed to get the job despite this! the fact i was hungover definitely impaired me and i would have been better if i had stayed sober, but the fact i know my job inside out saved my arse so it was clear i had what they needed. i definitely think if i had been on the top of my game i would have been able to ask for more money though. since starting this new job i am now based in an office so my drinking quickly became a real issue. i would be in important meetings feeling and looking like shit, just about able to stay awake and the days became absolutely nerve racking as i was sure people were on to me how could they not be? i would finish the day and be an absolute wreck so i would drink. heavily. i was back to a night and slipping again. my gaps became non existent i gained back all the weight i lost and functioning was a real issue, again i was certain i was near my end. from september to early november i went through this pattern. i have no idea how i didn t get fired, but instead my boss was lavishing praise on me and i was actually acing the job, i was a fucking mess and no doubt people know this, but the results were undeniably there and that s all they care about. i felt like a fraud thought, i was performing at and getting away with it. mid november i managed to single headedly find a massive saving to the company that even got the attention of the ceo who personally thanked me for my hard work. so all this time, i am coming into work still drunk, worrying my arse off, beating myself up and self inflicting more stress than i have ever experienced in my life wandering when i will get fired and i am still getting praised heavily? what the fuck am i doing to myself?! that realisation was a major turning point, it made me realise the catch situation i was in. i drank when i was stressed, i was stressed because i was hungover and unhealthy and therefore i drank. since then i have not stayed sober, but i consistently manage to stay sober saturday to wednesday and drink between beers the rest of the week. it has been easier to say no to drinks, and i am dealing with things much more healthily. my worries are shrinking and confidence is now much better than this time last year. i feel stronger and more able to cope with life in general. it is easy to look back at my year as a failure to get sober, there were indeed many nights where i lost control and promised myself this would be the last time. there were many failures and i failed to make the most of my potential. i caused myself so much stress and anxiety i am surprised i was able to leave the house some days. but it is important to look at the successes all in all, i went from drinking almost days last year, to probably drinking less than this year. i won my first tournament, i got a new job and through trial and error i am much more able to identify my weaknesses and strengths. i am certainly going to try again for and i think i am going to do it this time. it is unfair on myself to settle for anything less than my best and if i have achieved so much under the influence, i am excited to see what can be achieved by a sober me!",alcoholism

97.50366,-21.681618,"road to full recovery from anxiety! been really wanting to write this. before i put in the main content of this post, i want to give you a little back story. i have been dealing with general anxiety disorder for about a year and a half. this has been quite a difficult journey with many ups and downs. reason why i say many ups is because you learn a great deal through this process. it feels like i have grown more in the past year and a half than in my last years. you learn so much more about yourself and how your mind thinks. i have been always progressing in my recovery and then setting myself back because of weed or different drug use. two weeks ago, i would say i was good. i was at the top of my recovery. i felt amazing and almost forgot what anxiety felt like. i was able to consume several strong coffees within a day and anxiety! due to some drug consumption, i put myself back deep into heavy anxiety and depersonalization. it was on the th of april where i woke up and knew that i needed to start this journey once again. but this time it s different, i know almost all of the tricks in the book. i m not scared of the sensations, i know that i am going to be better and it s a question of time before i ll be tip top. since i m starting this journey back again and i feel i have a lot of experience, i want to invite you into it. maybe you re having hard time to get over your anxiety and your panic disorder. maybe you re having harder time seeing progress. i am going to describe the step by step methods that i will apply in order to overcome this. the most important key to recovery is to fully understand and believe that you will get better. you are not broken, this is not permanent just a temporary moment where you re highly sensitized. believe me that i know on how much this sucks and how much this can be a struggle. i know that some of you may find a hard time to enjoy life in general when you re in this place. but the good news is that this is only temporary and that you will get better! so, like i said earlier, you need to fully understand that you are not ill, you are not sick and that you are perfectly fine. you just need a shift in your mindset, take care of your body, be a little patient and voila. another good mindset to have when you re highly anxious it to remember that anxiety always calms down. when i m sitting in a meeting room and i just feel that panic coming in, i just remind myself that i need to sit down relax and that it ll pass in a few minutes. don t buy into your monkey mind that tells you to run. just stay where you are, as hard as it may be and you will see that it will magically pass. a panic attack is just a very high surge of adrenaline. your body is working fine. you just need to shift your mindset towards it. the more you practice this, the easier it will get until you won t have anxiety in those moments. do not be afraid of your thoughts! and one of the other points that i want to bring towards the shift of the mindset is the i don t give a f mentality. this one is also very key to progress. as soon as you adopt the i don t give a f mindset towards your recovery, how you feel in the morning, how you feel at night or when will you recover, you will see huge progress. we need to stop being so sensitive to these topics. this shift in mindset doesn t come overnight, you need to constantly remind yourself. if you wake up tomorrow and you re full of anxiety, instead of saying how much you hate mornings, say instead i don t give a fuck on how i feel this morning. say it like you mean it. you will see that your mind will buy into it a little bit. with this repetition, your mind will gain more and more confidence in your ability to cope with this. i ve had huge progress in the pass days or so just because of these mindsets. a year or so ago, i was beyond scared on how i felt or how i feel the next day. i didn t even believe that i would ever get better. i bought into every single story that i mind told me and i ran with it. this just made everything worst. i would like to talk briefly about routine and how it can also help you speed up the recovery process. every morning i wake up and i practice the wim hof method. you guys should youtube what it s about and it has been completely game changer for me on how i feel. i think this is a fantastic method that can really boost your whole body and mind to another level. when i m at work, out of lunches i go to the gym. i do minutes cardio and minutes weight lifting. helps me so much. after these workouts, my days become much easier. my anxiety drops considerably lower and i get into cruise control. at around pm, i meditate for about minutes. i subscribed to headspace and i m really enjoying it. if you don t want to spend the money on it, just simply put some calming music and try to focus on your breath. you can find many great youtube videos or podcasts on how to meditate. this is a perfect way to finish my day. as soon as i m done meditation, i go to bed at around and read a book. i stopped watching television before going to bed because when i read a book before going to sleep, the quality of my sleep is much better. read a great book that will distract you mind or help you grow. as for food, try to eat as much as possible natural healthy foods. plenty of healthy fats and good quality protein with loads of veggies and some fruit. this is a must must must. to end this long post, i would like to just tell you what symptoms i have and which symptoms got a lot better in the last couple of days. symptoms that got better within the last days depersonalization is almost gone. overall anxiety went from a . to a ish i d say. my mind is more focused. evening anxiety is pretty low. symptoms that are still hard morning anxiety is still very present. overall sleep quality is not that good i wake up way too many times . my dreams are very vivid but luckily, i m having good dreams. i get exhausted much faster throughout the day. also, i have many of the anxiety physical symptoms but they don t bother me that much. morning anxiety and my inability to drink coffee are the hardest for me right now. i will do another post same time next week with some other tips and tricks that will come to mind and will give you an update on my symptoms. remember that not everyone heals at the same speed. depending how well you accept where you are and how well you re disciplined in this process. if you have any questions, don t hesitate to ask me. best of luck and i wish you a speedy recovery.",anxiety

writing this getting out of a funk is tough, man. real tough. sometimes, it s funny how much effort i will put into actually not fixing my state of being, just so i don t have to come up with novel ways of solving what is by now an extremely intractable problem anxiety is occasionally running my life. i ve been in a state of almost constant analysis never mind the fact that i have no qualification to make any judgements on mental disorders since it really got cranked up, so long ago now. all my effort has been tied to finding and neutralizing some point of contact, some environmental impact, that occurred at some point in my life to cause a fairly easy going guy like myself to transform so utterly into a mess of nerves, jangles, and jitters and, yeah, occasionally a full blown anxiety attack if you want to call it that, which i obviously don t . one of the ways i have improved my situation is just by no longer being ashamed of my condition. i also quit bullshitting myself that i really used to be easy going as claimed above. i ve always been a worrier, but i had adopted a tendency towards stoicism as a sort of primary operating principle, and when things are going well enough, it s not that hard to maintain a facade. man, i wish i could pin it down, the exact reasons for my little problem, but just because i cannot explain it doesn t mean i can t claim it, to turn a phrase in the style of the very reverend jesse jackson. i m not sure that all my analysis has gotten me anywhere fruitful, but what i have noticed is this i have been wrong about the process of thinking. i have thought and made various claims for a long time now that human thinking is single threaded we have one thought at a time, through a field of time, which is linear and sequential. now of course time does take a linear path so far as we can perceive, and it does seem evident that one can only have one thought at a time, which occurs through our language as a set of modules that we construct on the fly to build thoughts, words, sentences, concepts, whatever. all of that does appear true. but what i have more or less neglected until now is the importance of this other less obvious thread that weaves in and out of the thread of thought, which is like an emotional thread. i used to think this thread was only functional in that it responds to what happens to a person in life, but now i m starting to see that, when things are going really wrong for me, it s because the emotional thread is going off and doing its own thing, out of alignment with what is actually occurring to me. in a way it s like a person is two separate beings, one which is responsible for outputting thought, and one that precedes, predicts and responds to thought. i think in a normally functioning human these two things are supposed to line up just so, but sometimes they don t, which causes what we call cognitive dissonance ..which for people like me causes an intense feeling of something is not right here. my anxiety does not always start or stop through the same process sometimes i wake up with it, sometimes i ll see a picture or read a sentence that starts it up, sometimes it will happen in traffic or driving at night all things just seem more dangerous at night, and my confidence in myself seems misplaced , sometimes i ll walk into one of the many places in this world that doesn t sit right for me for whatever reason usually big box stores, large college campus buildings and that will trigger an immediate sort of sense of holy shit what the deal yo, gotta run far far away right now now now now now now now now. and of course sometimes you can t run away without losing face. and, historically, losing face is a big deal for me. i do have some pride, and i do have a vision for the way i expect life to progress. anxiety opposes all expectation except getting and maintaining safety. when it gets really bad like that, i usually will have some warning, but sometimes not enough to stop it. and sometimes the things that stop it are entirely mysterious to me, as if that second thread is just easing up through some chemical process, or maybe some awareness that doesn t escape the subconscious level. there s a question of what works, then, to head it off at the pass, and that really seems to be the one key thing i ve got to figure out. i hoped i could reason my way out of this little maze never worked before, sure, but it s just my first line of defense for when i m still trying to cover everything up and act as if nothing is wrong , but the reason this doesn t work is because of that second thread i was just defining a moment ago you can talk yourself out of the reasons for your negative feeling until you are blue in the face, but if that thread that runs behind the thought doesn t match up, you re just whistling out of tune. so the thing to do would seem to be to somehow grab ahold of that second thread and make it do right, make it respond to the environment as i believe it s supposed to instead of its own whims. can you take an ssri and retrain that thread with therapy? i ve had not much luck at all with drugs that aren t addictive. xanax works like a charm but it does run out rather quickly, not to mention that most doctors will not prescribe it for very long there s a liability there that i do not fully understand or agree with but have come to accept. and i ve not done much therapy, but i m actually getting to where i ll give it a shot just because, why not? the ssris i ve taken for years have never once led me to conclusively feel that i ended up in a significantly better headspace. there have been long stretches of feeling really great, which twice coincided with the taking of ssris among other things , but doling out credit for that to a drug has been tough for me to nail down. now with the latest evidence showing that ssris do not seem to have much advantage versus the placebo effect, it is getting more and more difficult for me to even accept the possibility that a new ssri is going to do the trick for me, though i do accept the notion that for some few people they are really great. i wish i was one of those people. instead i seem to have a condition shrouded in mystery and misery, not knowing when or how things are going to begin or end. well poor me, i guess. back to the drawing board, and avoiding the depression that will follow along with this latest setback. so far i m actually doing well in that regard. i m trying to cultivate the resolve that none of this is a very big deal, while at the same time continuing to take steps to seek treatment. after all, it s a very fine line indeed between stoicism and neglect. edit couple of typos",anxiety

99.321335,-17.077105,"sadder than ever i am currently a sophomore at a big university and i have never felt so lonely and sad and depressed in my entire life. it all started when i moved to a different state before the start of middle school. i never fit in at my new school. at my old school, i was full of life and i was a star student. i got straight a is, i would win elections for student council, i had a fierce love for the performing arts piano, band, theatre, etc. i was so happy. unfortunately, that was all taken away from me when i finished th grade. my parents were the kind of people that liked to withhold information. i found out i was moving that very summer and i never got to say goodbye to any of my friends. at my new school state, i was so focused on my old school and some crazy notion that i could actually go back that i really was not living in the moment. there was a bit of a culture clash. i was from a small rural town and i moved to a wealthy suburb. i had an incredibly hard time making friends and keeping them . i was an insecure young girl and i was desperate to fit in anywhere. i tried to fit in with this group, but i was often ditched at the lunch table. i would sit there awkwardly eating alone. and it made me sad, and worse embarrassed. i often felt like that friend of convenience. people would chat with me until someone more popular or desirably came along. then they would act like they did not know me. i will never forget the time i went away on a school trip to canada in middle school and i would have no one to eat with when we stopped at restaurants. i learned that the five girls i roomed with never actually liked me and talked behind my back. when we stopped to go tobogganing at this place, we had to form groups. the roommates rejected me when i assumed i would go with them. it was so disheartening. i remember crying by myself in an isolated area. i have not even told my parents about this. as you know, middle school was a painful time. i thought high school would be better, but i was wrong. on the first day of high school i remember being blatantly ignored by every person i knew. i was sad and angry. i ate lunch a bathroom stall during that first week. it was not until someone i knew helped me out and found a group for me to sit with. the girls were all a year older than me, but i connected with them. it was the first time that i felt like i belonged. was i happier? i think so, but my insecurities from middle school carried over. i always thought that people favored other people over me. it was a very toxic thought. i always felt as if the prettier person was more well liked, even in high school. and here is the gist i never felt pretty then. i would remember how all the girls around me would get attention from boys and that i was unwanted. i know it is a stupid thing to harp on, but i was never asked to prom. i know that in retrospect it was a silly thing to get upset over. but at the time, this did nothing for my faltering self esteem. the problem was that at my school, the promposal was this outlandish display that every person looked forward to. it was hard to see some guy play an instrument for a girl in front of my entire class or someone to spell it out with giant letters for the whole world to see. it only asserted my loneliness. i must say that i had become extremely withdrawn in high school. i became so used to being ignored that i suspected that no one i interacted with truly valued me as a friend and that i was this temporary sidepiece. i did not go out my way to talk to people. i let them come to me and that was rare . i did not hang out with friends very often and i basically came home and sat in my room all day, looking at my computer. i was empty, i was sad. it was at its worst in high school, after my friends left. the most disappointing part about all of this was that i lost that light i used to have as an elementary schooler. i lost my spark. my grades suffered immensely. i went from being a top student to someone who still took challenging classes, but rarely cared at all. i could not concentrate. i was frustrated. i developed awful eating habits eating tons of junk food . i was always exhausted i passed out every day after coming home from school . i participated in performing arts extracurricular activities, but even that was only temporary happiness. i lost my love for music and piano. i quit during my junior year because i was sick of getting yelled at by my piano teacher. i stopped practicing while before, i used to play for hours on end . there was so much pressure on me to do well in school and get good scores on the sats that i suffered numerous emotional breakdowns. i told my doctor about my health concerns on two occasions and she recommended seeking psychological help. my parents refused. i guess my life is filled with many regrets. because my grades fell and i could barely concentrate, i did not live up to my fullest academic potential. i was rejected from my dream school in the ivy league, so, i settled for my current big with the intent of transferring out the first year. college was supposed to be better now that i would not be around the same people. oh boy, i was wrong. my insecurities carried over and i suffered from extreme shyness. the biggest problem is that i go to a party school, and i am not a drinker. people tell you that you do not have to drink to fit in, but let me warn you right now. based on what college you attend, it is pure bullshit. at my school in the middle of nowhere , all activities are surrounded by drinking. it is inescapable. it is the only way to meet people and be social. freshman year it did not help that i had a hard time connecting with people in general. i was hesitant to talk to people or be out going because i suspected that they never wanted anything to do with. it was not until the end of the year that i realized that my toxic way of thinking burned so many bridges and contributed to my own unhappiness. i had these great roommates who could have been great friends, but my chaotic state of mind prevented that. i cut conversations short because i never thought people were listening. i always thought i was unworthy. strange enough, at the end of freshman year, i was at these auditions. i usually kept to myself at these places. but something changed that particular day. i was in a group with two other people and i something within me just exploded. i began initiating, starting conversations... and people listened and they had a great time. it was a strange feeling. i felt this sort of high from it all. it reminded me of the good ole days back in elementary school when i was genuinely happy. in that moment, i felt as if i realized what my problem was and what i could do to fix it. i wanted to feel that high on life again and again. so, after that day, i have been more out going, more initiative, more optimistic about people. that semester, my grades turned around, close to a . . i read a lot of self help books to help me cope. i was excited to return to school in the fall with my new no judgment philosophy. sophomore year started out great. i was extremely busy with projects outside of school and i took classes that truly interested me. i got straight a is. i had a great roommate. i became a more open person, i made an effort to make friends and be a friend. i even went out a couple weekends and interacted with people. i did not drink very much at all, but i still had a great time. then, this semester, my roommate moved out. i live alone now. at first i thought it would be awesome to have a room to myself and i was not worried about delving back into depression again because i had already experienced the worst. things started out okay. i was less busy outside of school, so, i was in the room more often. i was doing okay for a while, but then loneliness kicked in. i do not know anybody on my floor because i was always gone the first semester. because we are no longer freshman, nobody really makes an effort to bond. i enjoy my classes right now and i talk to people i know. however, outside of that, i return to my room alone. i usually eat alone. i go places alone. i never actually developed a close friendship with anybody nor have i ever been a part of a friend group. in the fall, i had developed this dgaf, be yourself philosophy that i lived by for a couple of months. i became more assertive and i tried to find my old self again. but now, loneliness seemed to cancel all of that out. i have taken up exercising which has helped a lot. it was hard to not have anybody in middle school and high school, but now i feel even sadder in college. i am very close to my family and i call my mom almost every day. i walk this campus every day alone and i feel so out of place. i see people with their groups and i am always alone. i just wanted to be a part of something. to fit in. i guess it is this innate human desire. one night, i got extremely sick. i thought i had appendicitis. my phone had stopped working and i could not call any friends out of the blue to drive me to the hospital. since i did not know anyone on my floor, i skyped with my mom. it gets better. she was visiting family and a big group of people came on the webcam to wish me better. this was the only moment of my life that i cried because i was so happy. i always felt so insignificant, and to see that assertion of love was priceless. i was lucky that my brother was in town that night and drove me to the hospital instead. in a way, my sadness is worse than before because i do not have a light to hold on to. a piece of me wonders if i should have transferred and started over fresh somewhere closer to home. i am wondering if i am just not happy here or not happy in general. i miss the unconditional love of my family. i have made a conscious decision to go in for therapy this week and talk this out. there are many aspects of my situation that i have not talked about for reasons of privacy. i came across this area on reddit while looking for articles about college students feeling lonely. perhaps this is a good outlet to vent. i want to feel better and i am trying, but some days, i just do not know how.",depression

am i intimidated by her now? am i jealous? am i mad at her for making me parent and have no life while she builds her dream job? we had a talk last night after not really talking for a few days. i told her i am switching psychiatrists so i can go more often my current one is a little difficult to get to and has limited availability . that lead to her letting her thoughts out that we were basically on the road to a loveless marriage, which leads to us just raising kids until they leave then we are essentially roommates in our late is. again... she is absolutely right. my overall issue is this why am i being so mean to my wife?

74.10083,-58.727356,"does this count as a confession? i did not know really where to post this. i am writing this as it still haunts me to this day. i do not tell anyone about my depression as i always felt pathetic advertising it. first of all i should say this is not really a confession. it is just something that happened in my life that i have never told anyone. anyway here goes when i was i lived with my single mother and younger brother. my mom had me when she was twenty and struggled to raise me alone. my dad was around but pretty much stayed away. my younger brother was born years later after my mom became pregnant with her boyfriend of years. the pregnancy was unexpected, and their relationship quickly went south. i will spare you the boring details but after my little brother was born my mom is now ex boyfriend opened up a custody case in court to gain visitation rights with my infant brother. if you have ever been around or directly experienced a custody battle, you know they can get ugly. soon after my mom began battling depression. she was prescribed antidepressants that were not much help. sometimes the drugs would makes things much worse. since i was so young i mostly kept quiet. my mom had become emotionally unavailable and i was left to take care of my now two year old brother. my mom would lie in her room and sob for hours. the worst was when he would call my brothers dad . they would be on the phone for hours, my mom screaming and pleading. my mom started drinking while on her medication and things got worse. i remember the day very well that she first came to me. she had just gotten off the phone and came into my room. she was not upset like i anticipated but very calm and quiet. she sat on the edge of my bed and put her hand on my leg. i ca not do this anymore , she said. why not? i asked. she did not reply right away but put her face in her hands as if holding back her sadness. what she said next i cannot remember exactly, but i will give you an idea. she explained to me that she was going to commit suicide. she told me that she was going to take all of her pills, and then cut herself in the bathtub. i did not cry. i did not say anything. i think i was in shock at this point. she expressed how much she wanted my brother and i to stay together, and how sorry she was to have let me down. i simply nodded, afraid to speak. the conversation ended with a kiss on the forehead. this was not the last time this conversation happened. twice more my mom expressed to me her desire to end her life. the second time was much different than the first. she came to me very upset. she told me that she could not bear the thought of my little brother growing up with his father. she told me she was going to take her life as well as my two year old brother. she told me she wanted to disappear. she explained to me exactly how she wanted me to bury their bodies. i was to go to the location where they would be already gone and fill the hole, then return home and wash my clothes. the day after my mom apologized for her episode, chalking it up to exhaustion and sadness. the third and final time my mother came to me was much more matter of fact. she explained that after school i was gonna go to my aunts house. she would kill herself and my now year old brother while i was at school. i did not find out until later what happened. my mom called the suicide hotline. paramedics took her and my brother to the hospital. my mom had cut herself deep along both arms. my brother was unharmed. i lived with my father for months after until my mom was released and taken off the antidepressants. she does not remember cutting herself or calling the hotline. my mom and i have a good relationship now. i never felt any anger towards her. my brother was too young to remember anything so my mom and i are the only ones that know. i am a years old. i have not told anyone this whole story and i probably never will. my girlfriend of a year knows my mother attempted and told me before hand but that is all she knows. i just wanted to tell the whole story. i wrote this kind of in a hurry and as i read back over it i am realizing it does not really flow. lots of info over a long period of time. sorry for the novel. thanks for reading. edit formatting",depression
98.418846,-19.497313,"i feel like a failure. this is going to be long. tl dr at bottom, and throwaway for my own reasons friends know my real username . i do not know where else to turn. i feel absolutely worthless and i feel like i am living a nightmare. me and my wife have always been great. i love her, she is everything to me. and we are still doing great. that is not the issue. the issue is my work. let me explain... we have been together for over years, and we went from apartment, to townhome, to finally a house. we bought this house two years ago, and have loved it since. our only problem is, we would been using our savings to pay for our rent mortgage, only due to the idea that things were going to get better work wise. i have been at my company for almost years now. i started overnights in the warehouse, months later i moved up to a finance corporate position as a cashier of sorts, then just months later i was promoted again to counting, then another months the office same department, just handling the paperwork . fastforward another month or so our company was bought out. different feelings all around. we were bought out by the parent company. this could be good! this could be bad! who the fuck knows! our logic for it being good and this is a huge point in this post was that we have always been set on this payscale where there were no voluntary promotions or raises. you want a promotion? usually you would have to work hard and earn it, right? nope. that does not matter here. you need a raise for whatever reason ? nope, that is not how we work. we are the company a multi billion dollar company, but, you want to make more than k year before taxes after it is nearly k ? nope! too bad! so, we were thinking that the buyout would dissolve this payscale, as discussions went about it. there were promises, and everything. better healthcare, better this, better that, etc. then my department manager left. now we were at the mercy of a manager of an entirely different department, because they did not want to fill his position just absorb it. with no pay raise to those of us who picked up the slack. this manager can be nice, but about of the time he is flipping out over some bullshit. oh well, it is manageable no pun intended . or so we thought. okay, back to our office structure for a second from lowest to highest, it goes cashier counting office specialist supervisor... and then stops there. then you have the manager, instead of the department head. whatever. we can do this. moving forward another year or so... to, well, last year. layoffs began. not for everyone, but patches of people. delivery drivers, few staff in our department, and others. layoffs ended. now, september of last year. this is where things shifted. one of our two supervisors left for an accounting position. my time to shine! this is what i had been busting my ass for over the last years! i know i can do it! i know how to do all the tasks and duties, balance reports, everything. i had literally been bugging my supervisor and manager about learning new things, since i enjoyed it. i really loved this job! i applied. i interviewed. i heard i was the only one to interview. i have got this in the bag! but wait. someone else from another department interviewed for it? but she just got another job in our a p department? the rule is you have to stay in a new position for months before moving on. sweet, i have still got this! they chose her over me. they bent the rules for her. i was left speechless and heartbroken. since that day, i decided i needed to move on get out of this company. she is become tyrannical, treating everyone like absolute garbage and throwing people under the bus. this, in turn, makes the manager freak out and threaten us. we go to hr, but, of course, hr is there for the company, not the employees. so, that brings us to almost currently. been applying for jobs for a year, and had three interviews. after sending in well over applications honestly not exaggerating . first one january ? not a good fit. fine with me, the company was a bit scarier looking than my current job. second one june ? huge energy company, and had a friend that works there still does . tried following up after sending thank you notes, and never could get a hold of anyone. then, two weeks ago august , they call me finally to let me know they were picking someone else. oh well. i just applied to something else that another friend works at. third one august now ? my wife and i is friends used to both work there they are married, just had a kid . he left to go work for the government. she still works there. they both said they would be my references to there. they said be kind and you will get the job no problem! they like people that blend well with others, and have a good sense of humor. hard workers. team players. applied to them, received a test of sorts, completed it, they were impressed and wanted me to come in for an interview asap. i was ecstatic! this would be awesome! much better pay, better hours, and a group of all round nice people. this is where everything crashes. interviewed last week, felt great about it. loved all the people i met, was excited to have the chance to work with them all. they said i would hear from them by the end of the week, or beginning of this week. awesome! they called one of my references my supervisor. they did not call either of the two that worked there. weird. my supervisor praised me, as was a co worker, and were happy for me. i have never had a potential employer contact a reference of mine! i was so sure i had this! i was practically giddy from the idea that i would finally get out of this company, and move forward with my career! especially since i ca not move up within my current company it seems, unless someone dies or whatever. tuesday morning. i wake up to an email on my phone. the subject is employment opportunity . excited, i open it up. ... we have completed the interview and selection process, and have selected another candidate. ... and that is where i am today. i do not know what to do. i feel worthless. i fucked up. we are going to lose our house. we wanted to start a family, but we ca not now. i have been in this rut ever since tuesday morning. i have even prayed and i am not one to pray. i wanted it to all be a dream. a nightmare. but no. we are going to lose the house. we are going to lose the house by the beginning of next year. we are still going to be struggling with bills, groceries, and everything else. we are still going to stress about everything. i do not know what to do. i have contemplated suicide in the past, and this is the first time in a while it is come back to me. i do not want to kill myself. but i feel worthless. everyone would be better off without me. i am tired of trying. i am tired of sending out hundreds of resumes, cover letters, and applications. i am tired of putting all my effort in to my work, in the failed hopes i would get a promotion or a raise. i never will. my wife would get my life insurance, i would not have to worry about going to the doctor or medical bills anymore. she could find someone else that makes more and could support her. our friends wo not have to hear my bugging them anymore to find work or use them as a reference. my manager would be happy because he could just have my job absorbed and save the company k year. i am at the lowest point of my life. i do not know what to do. i do not know where to go from here. i would be better off dead. i do not know what to do anymore. tl dr my wife and i have been living on savings, hoping things would get better. they have not. working a shitty job, shitty pay, and have been trying my best to get out. was just turned down for another job post interview , and i am losing hope.",depression
-43.946487,-79.87236,"back on that slippery slope and i just wanted to vent to anyone who would listen. for a few months, it was all going pretty well...i would been eating right, my mind and motivation was as stable as i could have hoped for and the anxiety attacks had practically gone. i should have known that it could not last and surely enough, the past two weeks have seen me back into that all too familiar state. those anxiety attacks are the worst, that internal disorientation and discord that makes you want to punch yourself on the head until the dizziness takes over. i have learned to bear with the constant depression and try not to wallow too much in it, but once panic sets, all self control is lost and the little self confidence i have vanishes in thin air. i have a bachelors degree in engineering with honours, something that i realised half way through that i would not be able to handle career wise, but forced myself to finish. drained and depressed, i dropped off the radar, doing pretty much nothing until i was coaxed by my parents to take a grad course and try to figure out what to do next. honestly, next was not an option back then and to some extent still is not. the thought of professional work scares me. tonight is panic attack was brought by the realisation that my university is organising a careers expo and i need to brush up my resume and face industry leaders. the simple idea of having to face myself through a couple of pages and actually hand it to multiple people to be judged seems like the most daunting task in the world. i have had a couple of small jobs but it is now getting to the point where that just is not enough. for fucks sake, nearly professional degrees and nothing to show for on that resume, what a pathetic piece of shit am i! the thing about anxiety is the uncontrollable irrationality. as if the thought of that expo was not enough, i now have in my head the task of driving another source of anxiety to uni within peak hour, where i will probably have to spend mins finding a parking spot. oh also, that formal shirt that i am going to wear, well that also needs ironing, and i am back to having to talk to people who could radically influence my potential career and mentally preparing myself to put on that cheery and positive persona again. as cliche as it sounds, there is no one i can really talk to about it. i lost contact with most of my best friends after moving and even then, i am not sure i would trust myself enough to share. my current social group is a determined bunch with whom i automatically put up that fun and mildly confident persona, although the nervousness is starting to get through the cracks. i have tried a therapist but that did not work out and i did not want my depression to go on my medical record. as for my family, while extremely supportive, their logical and straightforward outlook on life just results in them getting more worried about my state and being unable to help, which in turn makes me feel even shittier. as such, i now tend to keep the anxiety to myself and keep the conversation light. being an introvert does not help either. although internally reserved, i have learned to project and handle myself as quite personable and cheerful, although large crowded settings are still sometimes challenging. however, my arecharge time , i.e. time i need to spend alone after social interactions, is slowly but steadily increasing. as a result, i am increasingly dreading all social interactions, especially the ones in the next two days. sorry for the length of the post and thank you for listening. i feel that this is the first time that i have been able to semi accurately put my feelings into words on a single page.",depression

94.30452,-36.549644,"on a self destructive path this is most likely going to be a long one, this is my first day on reddit and i have never had anyone to talk to before, i am using this as a venting method really... so i am fairly certain that i have been experiencing pretty severe depression lately, and i do feel like it has progressively gotten worse over time to reach the point its at today. i have a few theories as to what is causing it but i ca not help but feel completely powerless against the whole thing. it is very hard to pinpoint when i started feeling this way, mainly because my entire life i have never truly felt genuine when expressing myself to other people. i would know what i want to say but would never say it, as clich as it sounds it was almost like a voice inside my head. words ca not describe how lonely i feel nearly every single day, i spend of my day in my bedroom playing games on my computer games from my past mainly, always searching for that next big nostalgia trip, back when things were simpler . i leave only to go for a cigarette, and the occasional bite to eat. i do have a full time job though, i am actively trying to not become a layabout. my job is definitely where i feel the fakest, constantly smiling, always having a charming and up beat attitude while i serve customers. its all just an act. it always is, and has been, i put up with it because i work in a fish shop, and i genuinely do have an affinity with animals, especially fish. i could not bring myself to harm a fly. for someone who is i am actually a massive softie, all i ever want to do is help living things and save them. this is where i start to fall out with work quite a lot. many fish keepers out there may already know this, but for those who do not, let me tell you... fish shops lose so so many fish per day via fatalities. there is not really much we can do to stop it, it is of the time just the way the fish come into us. i feel like this is where i lose hope a lot of the time throughout the day, i always say today will be different, today is the day your life changes , a bit hard to think like that once i have euthanized the th guppy of the day. all i want to do is save every living thing, not add them into a black bag of poison because they broke out into a disease. so i get home from work most days around pm, and the first thing i do when i get in is reward myself for going out to work all day. the reward i will always give myself without fail is a joint. weed, bud, marujiana, whatever you wanna call it, i do it, daily, without fail, for the last year straight. from all i can recall there has been only a couple of nights out of the last where i have actually not had a smoke. now i know for a fact that i have an incredibly addictive personality, meaning i get addicted to things really easily. but the bud helps me cancel the world out, when i have not had a smoke i ca not help but feel like every single person around me is just so very fake, their emotions, their feelings, hell even their music taste is most likely warped and twisted and not even their own anymore, but that is another can of worms. i see this fakeness in literally everybody, even my own mother, i ca not help but feel that everybody who speaks to me is only saying what they think i want to hear, or if it is not, then it is an incredibly weird and warped view which just does not feel genuine to me. i would say if i had to fathom a guess at when this all started i would probably say it was the day i tried to kill myself, though it almost certainly started before then which is what led me to try it. so how did i do it? i tried to overdose myself on ecstasy, i figured if i was going to go out i may as well go out absolutely catotonic. now bare in mind i had never even done ecstasy before at this point i decided to neck of them at once, i did not know what it would do to me, i did not even know if it was actually deadly or not. but i did it anyway, alone in my room, laying on my back that is what proved to be the most dangerous part now while i was in this state i could not move, i could not speak, i could not really do anything, i threw up in my mouth and then could not swallow it, i was just destined to lay there, and slowly choke to death. now as far fetched and unbelievable as it may seem, i received a phone call during this time very unusual for me to get calls but it was actually my ex girlfriend, she stayed on the phone with me the entire night even though for around hours all i could do was grunt down the phone to her. and she is literally the sole reason why i am still here today. i owe her so much, and we gave it another go, but unfortunately, exs are exs for a reason as i found out around a month ago. but i wo not talk about that, i will let fresh wounds fester for a while longer. there is so much more i would like to talk about and vent but i feel like i am making this wayyy too long as it is, i could genuinely go on and on all day about this but alas, reddit is not a therapist. i suppose what i would like to say to finish off is that if anyone else is going through some similar shit, similar addictions or similar anything really, then please know you are not alone. there is me out here as well, just trying to break the cycle.",depression

99.27107,-17.208004,"psa re narcan dangers of excess first i want to apologise for the dramatic title. second i want to apologise to the wonderful people at medically safe injection centre think i got that right in kings cross, sydney, for taking so long to make this post. i have been putting it off but some thing that happened the weekend before last that i took a while to come to terms with has prompted me to make this a two parter. this is a harm reduction post, probably from the last person who should be giving advice on the subject. if you are not interested or think it does not apply to you then hit back but if you are the kind of person who has ever woken up surrounded by paramedics then this could be relevant. i m sorry if it seems long, rambling or full of unnecessary information but i have included a lot of side detail in the first post to show that, although i was obviously extremely drug affected, my my memory was not affected. i was contacted by a redditor who was working at msic after i made a comment regarding a strange incident that happened to me. apparently neither he nor the clinic head i met with i believe it was had heard of an incident exactly like this. for setting it was friday and i would just started a new job and been paid for my first half week. i would also recently finished years on methadone and moved to suboxone for the final months and found that i only required a of what i was prescribed as long as i kept myself occupied i had some brown european type gear no. that i would been hold since tuesday night that i planned to have after work but because i was feeling so proud of myself for getting a job plus making it work days without turning up pinned or pilled up that i decided to treat myself before work. i had a little taste of the approx. gram i had. the thing about european gear compared to the golden triangle sourced no. in australian and i have heard a few australians say this is that although the initial rush is a lot different and arguably much nicer it has pretty weak legs. so much so that even though i would shot the whole quarter before i left for work, i was stone cold sober before i was halfway to work. i had some benzos around lunchtime but this is pretty common for me. i have been scripted for years and am use to large doses. this was a fairly small dose by my standards, bigger than i am prescribed, but not a get high dose . i knew i was going to get on again that afternoon but none of my contacts were holding. i ended up having to go through a friend of a friend in the x. it was extremely lucky it was there otherwise i would not of bothered going to msic and just waited till i got home. if my roommate was doing his usual friday activity shooting meth then he would have been holed up tweaking, either at his dealer is place or locked in his bedroom, so he would not of noticed me plus he was use to seeing me nod off mid sentence then wake minutes and continue then sentence i was on so he would not of been alarmed if he saw me sprawled out . i told him to get caps and keep for his effort. i planned on doing two in hindsight even this was way too much and keeping the third for later in the weekend it was the weekend for grand finals for the two major football codes in australia plus there was a aus nz rugby test match on so it was looking like aq good weekend to be doing not much . instead of s he came back with s, saying that because we are going for a shot together we can just split it as water. i do not like holding heroin as solution as i ve read a lot of contradictory information on the subject of whether heroin converts back to weaker morphine when kept in a solution over time. this meant i had to have either or the whole . after the disappointing legs on the first gear i decided, stupidly, to shoot the lot. what i was not to know was that the gear was some of the strongest that had got round anywhere in sydney for a while the x is known for the easily availability, definitely not the quality, of drugs i barely remember taking the fit out of my arm before i hit the deck. i have od would a few times at msic and on every other occasion i have at least thrown the fit in the disposal unit before dropping out however most have occurred minutes after using, nodding out while spilling coffee all over the place sorry for that one too guys . msic are great at dealing with ods. they normally give you oxygen as a first measure as this brings most ods around and they know how much we hate getting narcaned. i am not sure if this was the case in my incident as they claimed it was a pretty serious od. i did not even know i would been hit. at that stage i would never been narcaned before and assumed i would wake up, if not hanging out, at least sober, but i was stoned as fuck. they kept me under observation a while but they ca not keep you there and i would had a friend waiting outside for ages so once i was confident i was not going to hit the deck again. it was approximately pm when i was narcaned. i went home and chilled out. did not take any more opiates or pills and had maybe bongs very little by my standards . i was nodding hard but i was able to talk with friends even though they all said i looked extra fucked up . just before midnight i went to the local ice cream joint. the staff there know me and am used to see me looking pretty fucked up but they were pretty concerned at my state and told me to have a seat till i finished my milkshake. next think i wake up to paramedics telling me i have just od would again. this is the important bit. i od would at pm, was brought back with narcan then od would again hours later despite not using any more opiods, benzos or alcohol. the people i met with at msic said that then generally accepted danger period for a secondary od to occur after narcan is hours. most medical professionals apparently think it is not possible to od without using again after hours. this was also the time period i would heard mentioned. so the important thing to take away from all this rambling is that you are not in the clear just because it is been more than two hours since you have been narcaned. you do not need to use more to od again. tl dr you can od hours after being revived by narcan even if you do not use more. part general arning about reckless behaviour. the story above was the beginning of a rapid down hill slide for myself. as i previously stated, i had never been narcaned before that night. i have now been narcaned times and woken up in hospital a couple times for benzo related misadventure in the same time period. the weekend before last was a real wake up call though. it took me until saturday just gone to fully process what had happened and possibly could still to me as a result. i came into some nice coke, which is rare in australia. not the fire that the local teenagers sell but stuff that was impressing people who would used in sth america in the s. i have also currently got a source for very, very pure smack if it is not in the range then it must have been made by khun sa himself so i decided i would have a speedball. started shooting straight coke about . pm. by about pm i was ready for that speedball. i mixed approximately mg of each and hit the deck almost immediately. when i woke up it was dark so i assumed it had been a while and i was ready to do the other mg of dope i had. of course i again immediately dropped. this time i woke up just after midnight on what i thought was friday night saturday morning. i had some massive blisters on my hand my immediately popped, resulting in massive scars, plus i was sore in different places two spots on the face, one each on the leg and chest which were the result of being passed out on the floor but i have had problems with circulation related issues from heroin before so i was not too worried. i went on with my life for the next day and a half till my room mate got home on sunday night. it turns out it was actually monday night. i would been unconscious for over hours and missed a job interview . i do not know how the fuck i am here to write this. i was kind of in denial for the first few days. my room mate still thinks it was just benzo related as i used money for household expenses to pay for the smack and i was too ashamed to show them my wounds or describe my problems. around thursday i was checking how the spots were healing when i realised that the spot on my chest was not from passing out with something digging into my side but was actually a lump under my skin to the side of my heart . combined with the circulation problems i was suffering and the huge wounds on my hand, the result was that i thought best case scenario i was in for major surgery, worst case i was going to lose my left arm. i freaked out by myself for a few days before i finally showed my room mate my hand. the wounds were obviously infected by this stage. he gave me antibiotics and aloe vera to put on the wounds which has worked surprisingly well and quickly . we put off going to the hospital as it was then saturday night and full of drunks. i still have not been though. my wounds are looking a lot better and the pain cause by the lump in my chest is not nearly as bad but i know i ca not avoid it forever. the main point of this second piece is just be careful. if you fuck up at the very least tell a friend or someone who knows you use and has some idea what can help. ideally just go to a hospital and do not be a fucking pussy like me. if you have made it this far i want to thank you for your time.",drug_addiction

98.57343,-19.111435,"how do i feel less frustrated with my brother? this will be long. please just skip to the last paragraph if you do not want to read this... as the only family member who took a proactive and medical forward action to my brother is health, i ca not help to feel a bit frustrated with my bro when he is not taking care of his mental health. being the youngest in my family, having to deal with a mother who is completely paranoid about any medical intervention so much so that she argues with doctors telling them that nothing is wrong with her son, constantly shamed my brother and has ordered him to not take his meds many times even going as far to throwing them out once this whole debacle started. i have since told my brother to not share with mother about any medication. she is and was in denial of my brother is mental health and would trigger him into frightful episodes with her actions, yet when she realized that her horrible behavior has triggered him to an episode she becomes a crying fit and starts acting guilty . overall, my mother is a deep narcissist, she fits the clinical npd. anyway, it is been me having to get through my brother about his multiple diagnoses, having to sort through and understand what is been going on about his health, having to fight my mother is influence in his life, having to witness him being hospitalized, taken in an ambulance, full on manic, psychotic episodes, and for them to occur a year later because he has not been taking his meds. figuring out hotels to sleep with him as i did not understand what was going on and why he is behaving like this. not knowing what to do many times. etc... i know the beginning of his journey it was hard for him because his meds would cause him to feel sleepy, lethargic, not himself. so i understand why he had a negative viewpoint on him and would eventually stop taking them. i felt the last episode and last hospitalization i finally got through to him, that he needs to take these new meds daily. again, do not tell mother. that i will not always be there and since i am moving, there will be no family close to him. it was just by luck and god is mercy that i happened to be there the past two times that he was hospitalized actually thinking about it, he was hospitalized times in years, so i am sure there is some i missed . in one time, the hr at his work had to take him to the hospital. he was let go from that position i believe. and i am thinking that he is learned from this and these multiple episodes. i have worked with his doctors. with the hospitals. was freaking scared and confused myself, but would go to the hospital everyday and be with him. i remember the first time he was there, they pumped him up with so many calming, etc.. meds, that he could barely open his eyes. he was a zombie. of course at the end of his stay, he was better, although a bit detached. but better than before when he was manic, laughing, talking, pacing up and down, violent, etc... so i have talked with him multiple times with these episodes. and i have come to understand the symptoms and when he is relapsing. but i am no longer in the same state with him and in fact, am across the country. so he has no family there to take care of him in case the worst happens. i am so happy and proud that he trusts me enough to listen to my advice probably because he saw me there in the hospitals so many times and knows i want the best for him . we have gotten so much further in his journey than we were all our other times. he has a pyschologist who prescribes him his meds albeit the psychologist office is hard to reach he is telling me, so it is hard to schedule appointments. . he finally is sticking to a schedule with medication and has been taking them daily. i believe him, even though he tends to lie, but i believe him because i see he is gotten his prescription filled. etc... so overall, the past couple of months i knew i was supposed to call on him to check on him and make sure he is taking his meds, but i have just been feeling very anxious about these conversations. anyway, now he is showed up at my place across the u.s. for the holidays. he is doing fine, he looked fine, i was relieved. i am assuming he is on his medication, because although i have not talked to him for a while, when i would call and would ask, he would always say yes. this consistency been happening for the past year. so just today i started noticing some beginning symptoms again. him staring at a wall a little bit longer than usual with a slight smile yes i am this observant now . and once i saw it, i asked him if he was taking his meds. and it turns out, that last week he tried to get it filled at his usual pharmacy but it turns out the doctor forgot to send it in. so he was unable to. i look at him incredulously, and then i had to now go into mother and caretaker mode which has begin to stress me out from me doing it before in such traumatic times for him. trying to gather all the details from him, when was the last time he took his medication, etc... so basically i had to push him to call his pharmacy, push him to get his prescription out of state, push him to find out when it would be ready, push him to finally lets go to the pharmacy this night, then at the end push him to take the dang pill although he began protesting that it says to take bedtime . it was because once i returned home because i noticed another symptom of his returning. him reciting some words to himself. he always tries to explain it away with some excuse, but i have since learned that to not believe a word he says, he is just unable to tell his symptoms. i think and thought that he was being consistent, that i do not need to worry about him even though i do. and i always try to tell him how great he was for keeping up with his medication, that this is preventative measure, that this and that, always try to reinforce this behavior. and to know that he was just ready to go a week or two without taking his prescription and for him not to feel self worry, and for me having to still be the the one taking the initiative for him. i mean, maybe i should cut him some slack that he was taking it consistently this year, and this was just his first time that he is been this long without taking it. but this is always how it starts. i am not in his state anymore. and i thought through all my annoying and uplifting conversations that he understood how important it was for him to maintain the four kinds of health in his life emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual . and guys, i probably sound, too overkill. sure, i am because i know he did not ask for this and neither did i. but i felt so frustrated today that his lack of medication was not his main priority. i do not want to hand hold him into taking care of himself. i know it is partly mother is influence and just his personality why he is the way he is no accountability and expecting people to take care of his life. ugh i am just very frustrated, and it is taking me back to remembering the scary times we have had the past couple of years. am i overreacting to this? should i take it as a positive sign that he is been taking his meds without me there and just had one mess up, or should i see this a cause for concern that he still does not seem to understand how important taking his meds are. i want him to be proactive about his life. i ca not continue doing it for him. reminding him to do this, to do that. i am certain that if i did not ask him about his meds, he wouldve gone two weeks without his meds, and who knows, maybe in a months time it would have turned into a full on episode and it affecting his job prospects, and everything again. and him having to start all over. i just do not understand why he could be this careless with this. why does not it feel like he cares about this? i know he does, obviously, and i feel deeply sad for him that he was this unlucky to have to deal with this. it is not fair. i am just frustrated. and sad for him. and even frustrated with myself about how i feel.",schizophrenia

how do i save us? it breaks me everyday to see him acting strong for the sake of this broke family when i know someday it will break him and nothing can save him. i could never live with myself if anything happened to him because of this. i know this is not directly suicide related, but i am lost in between keeping myself going and findings ways to help piecing everything together. i feel like i could keep writing forever because i do not know how to make ends meet. if i have posted this on the wrong subreddit please move it and do not delete it, because i do not know what to do or where to go with this. i will monitor this thread for many hours more, so please help me, because i feel everyday like time is running out. sorry if this wall of text seems incoherent, my head is just a mess right now and i could not do better even if i wanted to.",suicidality
