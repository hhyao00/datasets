9.783548,19.382488,"my father is addicted to my prescription so i need some advice on how to handle this situation because, in all honesty, it is so bizarre, surreal, and inconvenient that i do not know how to properly deal with it all. before i get to the point, there is a lot of context that i need to go through to help fully understand the situation and the relationship that i have with my father. my father was incarcerated for crystal meth when i was , so i did not see him too much growing up. i did a lot of drugs of different varieties throughout school, but when i turned , i left my hometown for new york to get away from it, where things did not work out so well financially. i called my grandfather for advice on how to get back on my feet, where my grandfather suggested that i work at the same place my father does in a different state. my grandfather ordered me a bus ticket after i set up a job there and i headed that way under the guise that it would help me bond with my father and get me back on track to a normal solo financial situation. my grandfather also provided a vehicle for my father so that we both would be able to share it, however it was put under my dad is name for cheaper insurance. it was a seasonal workplace, so people party, drink, and do drugs every now and again, and my father was part of that lifestyle still, so given the fact that i had not become completely sober as of then, i would partake in most of what he did at those housing parties. i eventually qualified for the company health insurance, where i had never actually gotten any diagnosis before, and thus, decided to see if my suspicions for having a.d.d. were correct, where according to my doctor they were which was a major relief for me as the adderall prescribed to me truly does help me focus and perform tasks that i previously did not have the attention span for. when i got that prescription, i told my father about it, because it was such a relief to know that a lot of my failures to complete tasks growing up were suddenly validated in my mind... but that is when it started becoming an issue. my father informed me that he knew a dealer that was a hour drive away for adderall, and that each pill costs him . he mentioned this before i got my prescription, but i never saw him take adderall except once, and he implied that the guy was too far away to make it worthwhile. being as to how we shared a car, and it was never gone for elongated periods like that, i could only assume that he truly never went to that dealer. a day after i told him about my diagnosis, he asked if he could have a couple, where i made the mistake of letting him have for a for fun thing. i never really sold drugs before and do not have any intention to, so i just let him have the two. i then only furthered the problem by letting him pull the wool over my eyes when he asked for a few more because he was going to be working a lot, so it would be something to make it easier on him . i figured that he was a responsible adult who was being genuine about his usage, and so i gave him a few more. when he asked again though, i brought up the fact that i am worried that he will become addicted to these, and that i do not want that. i told him that i only really am giving what i have been because it would save a lot more money than him driving so far out and then paying more money on top of it. that is when he started exploiting it. since the car is under his name, it technically belongs to him. so if i ever decline to give him any, he says that he is going to drive out to the dealer is place on day generally the day of the week where i start work and then be there until generally the day after my work week ends . i generally try not to care, and figure that it is just something where i can get a taxi and take it to work, or use some other alternative method, but in reality... it is more detrimental than i anticipated. we live in a somewhat uninhabited town population is around but the town still has a major seasonal attraction and so everything is expensive. it costs me to go one way along the mountain generally i only pay to go up and then find a way back down . i ca not feasibly afford to do this and save up to just cut my loss and get a car of my own under my own name. how am i supposed to deal with a situation like this? my own father is basically holding me financially hostage over my prescription. i know that it is my fault too, but i did not expect it to happen so maliciously so quickly. i thought he had at least some self control in that regard, and i was wrong. none the less, while i understand my mistake, i still do not know what i should do. my initial goal was to bond with my father, have him save money on the drug that he planned to spend a lot of money resources to get, and to make his interaction somewhat safe than going through a deal and having illegal narcotics in his car. now i am unable to get out of this situation as easily as i would like. i want to just sit down and say i think you have a problem a second time, but the first time i did it, he used my concerns about his addiction to guilt trip and blackmail me for more. i myself have been completely sober for a year now, including having stopped smoking. the only exception is that i have been prescribed adderall six months ago, which i take as prescribed two instance of mg a day . is there any advice on how to handle this? how to not feed his addiction without losing my own financial well being? this is a man that i did not grow up with, but wanted to get to know due to him being my father, but this new side of him makes me wonder if it is a good thing that he was not in my life growing up.",addiction

i know some of you feel me... in my opinion, weed is one thing... but man, the cartridges pens are a whole different beast! i could literally be high all day now and that is what i have been doing literally every day for months and years. i am high more than i am sober. and when i am sober i want to get high... yall know how it goes... im done smoking ends up smoking then, ahhh god, why did i even smoke this is not even that good! i withdraw hard from weed. i am talking cold sweats, nausea, insomnia like you ca not believe and most of all i contemplate my life, my existence, and my future. i go back to where i do not see the point in living, i do not enjoy life as is plain and simple. i realize this is not normal and i wish i were not like this, but i am... my brother just got his medical card and he treats it like medicine. he essentially has his day down to the dose, and it seems at though he is going to live the rest of his life like that. i have been debating this over time and i concluded that i may do the same. just feed my addiction so i can feel normal, i feel like that is actually possible due to the minimal physical side effects. the main problem, besides being addicting to cannabis is that i have to stop smoking for a drug test, so i can become an emt for this hospital i want to work for. firefighting and ems is something that kept me in check for most of my life but just recently my addiction got so bad i would smoke my pen even though i knew i was on shift that night and that i could be running into a burning building at any point. so this was good to type out so far and already has made me feel a little better but i want to end with two things. first, what are your thoughts and feeding into the addiction and jut financially supporting it for . lifetime. people smoke cigarettes there whole life and pay for it... why ca not i just do that with weed. so long as i do not run out, it will not be a problem... and secondly, more importantly, how can i become more okay with being sober and what can i do to feel better when withdrawing so hard. i have been referring to this thread often and i think just talking to people going through similar stuff is of great benefit to me. like i said.. day right now each hour is a drag, sometimes even every minute can feel unbearable. i have been sober before for a few months some years ago and it was alright but that is it. i called my psychiatrist today and asked him to make an appointment because i think i am going to need to get back on the sleeping meds and anti depressants if i have even a shot of getting sober. literally anything yall could say to me would be greatly appreciated. thank you if you read all of this, you are truly an angel. thanks again and stay safe everyone.",addiction

i am lucky to really be into dancing, and so once or twice a week i will go dance to edm for hours and sweat it all out. i have a few girls i see once or twice a week. i eat well, meditate, and workout. have hobbies. good parents. but still, my fuck, this is challenging. this is probably the th time in the past few years i have tried to stop smoking weed. it is the furthest i have made it. i would not have been able to do it had i not been given the confidence from nofap. i stopped fapping november st because i wanted to meet more women. somehow it worked, and that gave me the confidence to trust my past self in determining my present and future. i am starting to see the benefits of not smoking weed i have been reading so much, and i just feel better in general. i am also aware of how many words i lost from smoking, or memories of times out with good friends. i am also aware of how dumb a lot of my friends are when they are high, and how they are smoking away their futures. not that i am totally against weed...obviously, it is amazing. but this sobriety is a worthy challenge. sorry this is such a clusterfuck of randomness but i am just regaining my writing work ethic and part of it is just accepting i kinda suck and am relearning a lot of things right now, and that is fun. this might apply for those struggling with depression. i am a creative person thing wannabe, and losing my creativity has been the hardest thing what always makes me go back. but i seem pretty at peace with accepting i never learned how to really do it sober, and that is more long lasting than the shortcut of weed. it seems like a shortcut, but you are fucking your brain long term. so i am having fun with building my work ethic back and using all the rage and fury for good workouts sex dancing. i guess i wanted to say, do not think this is over after the first month! this is a change your lifestyle thing. you really have to become someone else, if you have been abusing weed for a long time. so if you are where i am and you are still struggling, then that is normal for me so do not feel weird. thanks sorry.",addiction

-48.8067,83.96073,"day reflections and observations it was the hardest day so far. it was not cravings at all. i almost did not get these since i stopped. i woke up really tired today. it was raining all night and an effect of a chinese water torture kept me awake and irritated, starting at am. that is how it started. i was low on energies on my way to work, nothing like the previous days which were amazing and in which sobriety was exciting. commute on train, i felt irritated by the world tried a meditation app but it made me feel more irritated. i got some work done, which distracted me from everything and felt pretty good. i think that so far, the strongest effect of being sober was that work became so much easier. i needed to go to run an errand a little later, which gave me time to think i was walking . now this is the point i have to provide a little more context. let is just say that i did something that i am not very proud of in my past. it happened years ago at least a couple of years and i never really worked it out with myself. i am pretty aware and spent years in psychotherapy, but it was before. i smoked the last years, but i smoked much more during the last couple. it must be related to the fact that i did not really want to work on the roots of what bothers me and so i chose to fade it using green clouds. it kind of helped, it is not that i forgot about it, but you know, i was thinking about it from time to time and then it just went away. sometimes, while high, it made me feel more anxious, but it was rare. now, one of the things about quitting, i guess, is that you now have to deal with all the stuff you needed to before but you kept procrastinate. another observation since i found this amazing sub last week, i read so many posts from folks who are going through the same thing. description of people smoking another one and then another one, every minutes or so, just to chase the next high, which never arrives. i read things that other people wrote, and i felt they were describing exactly what i went through, more accurately than i could. this is pretty amazing, and i am grateful that i found this place. it made me wonder though do all heavy smokers feel this way? does anyone stop enjoying it in a certain point and from there on it is just the addiction? what about snoop dog? he seems to enjoy it still as if it was his first spliff every time he lights one up. it may sounds funny, but i am seriously asking. another last observation for the day i read many people here that dropped out of college, lost jobs, lost money, lost friend and family. i did not. i materially succeeded constantly while smoking. i studied, i work as an engineer in one of the best companies in the world, i got promoted a couple of time, i have family, i bought a house. i am not saying this to make other feel bad. weed made me feel bad in my head exactly as it did for the rest of us. i just feel it sometimes make it harder for me to stop. if weed would made me loose my job, i could at least say look what happened because of weed , if you continue, it will only get worst. but again, materially, it was not bad at all. spiritually and mentally it was hell most of the time. one last thing, i read someone on this sub saying i ca not remember where it was i do not hate myself for what i did. i love myself for what i am doing . or something similar. it helped me a lot, so i hope it can cheer up others today. thanks all of you for making this amazing place what it is. you mean the world to me.",addiction

-81.051674,0.358101,"i have had adhd all my life, time to address it while not professionally diagnosed yet anyways i along with a few close friends have came to the conclusion that i have many clear symptoms of adhd. i have a very difficult time focusing and remembering things. i often mentally wander off, become easily distracted, and get lost in my thoughts. sometimes i will catch myself and sometimes others will recognize it and point me out which can become socially embarrassing. having these issues makes me very easily frustrated and can affect my self esteem leaving me feel horrible about myself. no matter what i may be thinking, i always feel mentally restless and my mind does not ever stop, including when i try to go to sleep. i often become distressed, worried, and have an anxiety about my troubles and the difficulties that i will face day to day. i spend many of my nights laying in bed hopelessly trying to fall asleep as my mind continues to race on and on throughout the night. it usually takes anywhere from hours to fall asleep and in some cases, i can t sleep at all adding to the enormous toll that adhd has already put me through. people often overlook and confuse my adhd by impetuously labeling me as depressed or lazy. this unfortunately, is a very common issue which causes lots of people to not get the help they need. when i try and talk about my issues with my parents, they just disregard my concern and shrug it off as nothing and tell me that i need to just pay attention. interestingly enough, paying attention, staying focused, and being able to recall information is my exact problem. i have always had trouble in school, barely getting by with low c s and d s even with having special classes, extended time on tests, and private tutors. there was a point in high school where i went through a deep depression because of my adhd nearly causing me to drop out. i have been to psychiatrists once in middle school and once in high school to help me handle my emotions of going through depression. going to a psychiatrists not only did not help me, but it made me worse. i was not doing bad in school because i was depressed, i was depressed because i was doing bad in school. going to a psychiatrists just reminded me of how bad things have gotten and just made me feel even worse. every time i d get into the car to go see my psychiatrists i would just think to myself oh boy, time to go talk about how fucked up i am, again... . not to mention, in high school, when i was getting counseling from my psychiatrist they accused me of abusing drugs and alcohol which i have never done in my entire life. i never used drugs or drank alcohol which is one thing that i was very proud of. i told them to go ahead and test me to prove i was not lying. at the same time, i became very upset that i was falling into a category and being labeled as a druggie which i strayed away from all of my life. they immediately responded by recommending that i just use antidepressants and i ll be just fine. seeing how i was being treated and how they were just trying to make a quick buck of prescribing me anti depressants, my parents pulled me out of the sessions. since then, i just been trying to ignore my problems and continue on in life. now that i m trying to move on in my life, become more independent, move out onto my own and mostly importantly go to college, all of my problems are starting to resurface. i now realize that in order to move on and be the best i can be, i need to stop hiding my problems. my adhd is a challenge, but it cannot be my excuse. after having a small chat with my parents we called our doctor and they recommended that i see a neurologist. i will get to see my neurologist in weeks. i have my fingers crossed that this time around that i will be listened to and get the help i ve always reached for. all hope goes to putting an end to my adhd and being the successful person that i ve always strived to be.",adhd

-51.59998,7.9647884,"medication update switched from foquest to concerta hi, this is a follow up to my original post in which i described my experience with a hour mph medication called foquest, which i found was not for me due to its excessively long duration and midday loss of effectiveness. initially, i was going to switch to biphentin, which is a hour version of foquest, but after doing some more research i decided to ask my doc to switch me to concerta instead. it seems that methylphenidate is subject to tachyphylaxis acute tolerance , which means that in order for an mph based medication to maintain its effectiveness throughout the day the concentration of mph must be constantly increasing, i.e. not remain stable or drop. concerta was developed specifically with this in mind, ie it releases a small dose of mph immediately and then continues releasing higher and higher concentrations until it peaks at the end of its advertised duration. its release profile has no troughs , just a plateau for a short period. both biphentin and foquest and ritalin t.i.d. have midday drops in mph concentration , which to me seems to explain the apparent loss of effectiveness i experienced with foquest after the initial release. that being said, i have not tried biphentin known as aptensio in the us so i ca not make any conclusions and ymmv either way even with foquest. it is good to have a diversity of medications as different people have different needs and metabolisms. all in all, i am satisfied with concerta. however, the seemingly miraculous effects of mph that i experienced when i first started taking it have subsided somewhat. i get more distracted and my impulse control is not as good as it was originally, so i still struggle from time to time to get work done consistently, but i am still much better than when i do not take it. maybe i have developed a tolerance for it and need to titrate my dose up or take a medication break like some people have suggested. either way, i am so happy i am getting treatment for this annoying and handicapping condition. i am finally done beating myself up over something that is not my fault, and just that makes my life so much easier to live. ps here are some sources of my information",adhd

. we did not have professionals back then who would have noticed adhd. i am living in usa now, but where i grew up, we did not have psychologists or anything like that. it was a rd world country and a dictatorship during my parents generation. it changed around the time i was born. to give you an idea our elementary school was at the church, all the grades shared one teacher and one classroom. we did not even have supermarkets, internet, etc. if you had a serious illness or injury you had to travel by ship to the mainland, which hardly anyone did because it was expensive. i am the student everyone thought would have some amazing scientific career, but my life now, as a year old woman struggle to do basic minimum wage jobs, struggle to keep my house presentable even though i have literally no responsibilities, quit college because i could not complete assignments even though i already knew the material american college is like high school where i am from, so i already knew everything . i got incompletes as a grade. the professors told me i was smarter than that, clearly know the material, just need to try harder i still do not have my driver is license. at one point i was so upset i decided that is it, if i ca not have a normal life then i should atleast try and make it a fun life . but my executive dysfunction kept me from having fun too, be it knitting or playing video games! i see women looking for diagnosis who get asked have you ever tried a planner ? yes, of course i do. in fact i even use a planner and to do lists to play video games because i ca not otherwise! even so, the games are a huge struggle. i hardly bother playing games because it is more exhausting than fun. my life is consumed by coping mechanisms to deal with executive dysfunction. i do not even go pee in the morning after i wake up because if i do not do my morning chores right away, they wo not get done. i have been told... it is your depression... it is your anxiety... it is your ptsd... but... i journal, and of my worries are because of how my life is as a result of my executive dysfunction. the other are worries that can be fixed by learning boundaries i only learned this year that it is okay to be assertive, have boundaries, needs and wants. this is common with people who grew up in abusive families and i am working on it . but really, it is your depression, you said you do not want to live. that is depression . the reason i do not want to live is because i think no year old should have to live like this. i have never attempted suicide, i just have a passive desire not to live because i struggle to live a normal life. the anxiety and depression are manageable without medication or therapy , after i learned basic coping skills i was not taught growing up self soothing skills, exercising, taking a nap, etc . but the executive dysfunction never goes away so i still feel very afraid that my life is always going to be a struggle. i keep pushing, asking for help . i am told to do a sleep study. i have to wait until january for a doctor appointment, and knowing the wait times in my area, probably another months after that for a sleep study. and if sleep apnea does not turn out to be the problem, how much more time will i lose before someone finally diagnoses me? i notice anxiety rising at the thought of waiting so long, but i do not think it is unreasonable anxiety. i am . i want to start my adult life ffs! i want my hard work to pay off... i want my dreams to come true... even if they are simple dreams like making more than minimum wage, making a website which i know how to do, but ca not put it together , or getting my driver is license. i am afraid if the sleep study turns out okay they will come up with another reason why it is not adhd . i half expect them to say it is ocd because of all the behaviors i have had to start to cope with executive dysfunction. for example, checking and rechecking i have everything i need for an appointment, even tough i got my purse ready the night before. checking an rechecking my planner and to do lists because i ca not remember what i wrote even though i just read it. carrying a notebook everywhere and writing as much information as i can so i do not forget anything important. am i just crazy? or can anyone relate? this is so sad to me, i just need to get it off my chest. hope it is okay. i do not care if it is adhd or not, i just want whatever it is to be fixed so i can start living. thank you for letting me vent, people around me do not get it. you are so smart, you do not know your potential, you should be able to do anything you want if you put your mind to it okay. time to go rake the leaves and work this energy off.",adhd

9.201331,21.047915,"my story young in aa disclaimer i do not represent alcoholics anonymous as a whole. i am but a member. this is just my experience. by the grace of a god i did not believe in, good sponsorship, lots of meetings, a consistent homegroup and the fellowship, i have been sober since july , . as i write this, i have been sober nearly a decade. i can hardly believe that coming from where i came from. let me start at the beginning the beginning i grew up in the western us in a middle class family. i was the eldest of siblings and certainly not the most popular kid in school. both my parents drank and later went on to develop severe alcohol and drug addiction. as a side, i do believe alcoholism is a family disease. however, them being alcoholic did not cause me to be alcoholic more of a predisposition , my sister is not alcoholic and plenty of people from non alcoholic families become alcoholic. in high school, i remember having a difficult time finding a friend group. one week it was the nerdy guys who played video games and raced remote control cars. another week it was the jocks. and the week after that the popular guys and gals. sometimes i would hang out with people from my neighborhood. i did not fit in. i did not feel anything like other people looked. i thought that if they really knew me, they would hate me just as much as i hated me. that all changed at halfway through that freshman year. a friend that lived down the road asked if i wanted to try drinking. not a week before that, i had tried marijuana for the first time. i agreed to try drinking with my friend. my grandfather lived near us and had stockpiles of beer in his fridge. he was also an alcoholic. we devised a plan to steal one of his packs of beer, he had probably other packs and we thought he probably would not notice. we easily swiped a pack and got it out of his house. we went down by the river. i still remember the taste of that first beer milwaukee is best. i drank of them and the magic happened. i felt on top of the world. i finally fit in with a group of friends. my fears fell from me and i was able to come out and play. i had fun, we ran around laughing and acting crazy. it was one of the best experiences i have ever had! progression from that first experience, i was hooked. i told myself only on the weekends. that lasted a few months until some opportunities presented themself to drink during the week. i drank as much as i could as often as i could. my grades suffered a bit but it was worth it. my parents found out after a little while and they were not pleased. they were only starting to have problems with drugs and alcohol themselves at this time. by the second year of high school, my drinking had entered a second stage. i started skipping school and going to house parties. i would often ask homeless people to buy me booze. i was stealing wine and malt liquor from grocery stores. aside from some trouble at school and subpar grades, i had very little consequences at this time. but something was happening. alcohol was no longer an occasional thing i did for fun but a necessity. the bleak end by the time i was , things had gotten out of hand. i skipped school so much, i decided i ought to drop out. i got a high school equivalent and began working. this only increased my drinking. now, i had several thousand dollars and all the time after work to drink. although this is an aa subreddit, i will say i used a lot of marijuana as well. i experimented with a few other drugs my friends offered me at parties but overall, alcohol was my lifeblood . i began waking in the morning craving drugs and alcohol. i would be angry when i realized i was sober in the morning. it was no longer o clock after work drinks and weekend binders, i would drink in the mornings. i decided to quit my job. they did not respect me. besides i had saved several thousand dollars which would last me a while. i would go to city college, that will solve my problems. however, in a few months, i was as bad as ever. i convinced myself to stop going to my classes and drink to oblivion. i felt so alone and desolate the last few months of my drinking. i ran out of money. i would beg my mom that i was still living with for money, just enough to get by. when she would not give me money, i would steal it out of her purse. i hated myself. i hated drinking, it was not working. i needed something different. i knew that if something did not change, i was going to end up in jail, dead, or even worse, keep drinking for another few decades with more pain and suffering. sobriety i stumbled into sobriety because a friend asked me to come to a meeting. i had no idea what aa was. i remember telling him, no! i do not want to go with you to your drug and alcohol classes! he persisted and eventually i tried it out. i remember my first meeting. i was certain that the person running the meeting worked for the state or some treatment center or something. little did i know, he was chairing the meeting to try and be of service. i went to several other meetings. one meeting was in a small church. a young guy approached me afterwards, do you have a sponsor? do you need a big book? i barely knew what he was talking about but i knew if i did not say yes, i was going to relapse i already had slipped a few times in that first month . there was something about how confident he was and how happy he was to be sober, i wanted what he had. i started meeting with that guy and we went through the big book. since that time at age , one day at a time, i have not had a drink. i turned in sobriety never had a legal drink . i graduated from college in sobriety. i have gotten married in sobriety. there have been ups and downs but overall, my life continues to get better every day i stay sober. thank you all for my life! x b resources to getting sober . meetings this has been the key for me. meeting makers make it. . sponsorship. find someone who has what you want and knows how to stay sober. preferably with more time than you and of the same gender. i am available to sponsor remotely if you need a sponsor, dm me.",alcoholism

everything went wrong. i was blacking out nights a week. i ended up breaking my shoulder on thanksgiving of last year, i do not even remember it. i slashed my roommates girlfriend is tires, i do not even remember it. my girlfriend cheated on me with a touring band she was photographing, i did not remember when she told me about it. i went to a hockey game, i do not remember past the first ten minutes of the second period. i was doing almost an ball of cocaine a weekend, stealing liquor from work, spending all of my money on booze and drugs. i did not eat for almost days. my girlfriend and i ended up breaking up, i continued my behavior on an elevated scale. same shit, a month passes, i blacked in with a gun in my mouth at am. i was now ready to accept that there was something wrong with me. i traveled back home to texas for a week to try and gather my thoughts and be near some family. i ended up spending a night in jail four days later for a public intoxication charge. i had even been dropped off by a dd, and was found wandering the streets at am. i blacked in while i was in jail, very confused. i spent the week in texas, returned home for the three days. i was not sober for more than an hour in those three days. i ended up drinking my roommates liquor, invited people over to do cocaine at am i was confronted by him and wanted to drive off a bridge. i decided to leave for home. i packed my vehicle with as much as i could, informed him i would send him rent bills until our lease ends in august, and set off. i have been down here for weeks. started work at a very nice restaurant, while drinking. i was doing okay because i would only drink before my days off. it is okay, because work is not impacted, i can drink shots of whiskey at the bar and make an ass of myself as long as i get to work. two days ago, i was asked by the owner, gm, and the asset manager to take over the restaurant. it was a dream job, i have always ran bars, but never a fine dining establishment. they were going to pay me a fucking ton of money. i would finally not be poor, after almost years in the business. everything was going to be okay. i got off shift, and decided i had earned a couple drinks to celebrate. i would not be starting my new duties for a few weeks what is the harm? hours later, i woke up in my backseat in the middle of the desert to a cop knocking on my window. i had attempted to drive home the miles, through a very dark and isolated desert with no cell service, and pulled over to sleep. my car was parked in front of a fence, like it was a spot. i was so confused i did not even pull to the shoulder, like i was exactly where i intended to be. the trooper administered a field sobriety test to me at am, me in my skivvies. he cuffed me, took my to the county jail, administered a breathalyzer test. i was feeling confident because surely i had not drank that much, some time had passed, i could surely talk my way out of it. . bac. i drove miles, blacked out, hours prior. i do not even want to think what the level was at when i was actually behind the wheel. i spent most of the day in jail, i was bailed out around pm. i was an hour late for work, i called to explain the situation sorry, no thanks, you are fired. in hours i went from being handed the fattest promotion of my life to being unemployed, broke, no id, dwi charge, car is impounded, me entire family being upset with me i have always been pretty suicidal, but that evening was incredibly rough. i have been asleep since i got back from jail two afternoons ago. i finally do not feel hungover. i am so unbelievably mad at myself. i have known i have had this problem for years. i have known i should have tried something different. but, i never really did. sure i took a week off here, days off there but i always came back to it. and came back to it harder than ever. that basically concludes me story. it feels rather nice writing it all out. i am just trying to wrap my head around everything. i am about to leave to spend the last of my money to get my car out of impound, and start a new job at a restaurant in town. i do not know what everything is going to look like, but now i know i do not ever want to drink again. i have wasted so much time behind bar counters, behind bottles, and behind my own stupidity. i am fucking done with this shit. thanks for reading, sorry it was so long. iwndwyt.",alcoholism

-67.72246,62.37376,"moderate drinking since december a few thoughts hello friends, so i ve been lurking this subreddit since late december. that s the time when i realized, i had a serious drinking problem. since then, i started to work on my drinking habits. like many of you first with the goal to get back to moderate drinking. this subreddit was a big help, so i thought i should also share my thoughts and story. i am years old now, had my first drink with and developed a really bad habit at , when my long term girlfriend left me. so the last years i have been drinking heavily and it got worse and worse as months past by. since i split with my friends and roomates a year ago and started living in my own apartment, it got worse. most of all because of loneliness. i am not completely fucked up but i definitely got a problem. i work out, i am finishing my degree, i got friends, a good relationship with my parents and a wonderful girlfriend. hell, even my grades are quite outstanding and i have no idea how i managed that in the past months. question is if i didn t spend almost every evening for the last months drinking not to blackout level, but still beers an evening , how much farther would i be at right now? on the moderation part i am not too sure if it s working out. i can go without a drink for days and weeks, but there is a specific situation where i get serious cravings and often give in. i can drink moderately and quit drinking always as i am out, but i get serious relapses which end in day binge drinking whenever i get together with my family or girlfriend they live in different towns and then go back to my apartment after a few days spend together. i get so lonely and depressed, that i often just give in and start drinking. next morning my brain is chemically fucked up and i turn to drinking again and again. until i quit after three days. i developed a few strategies, which help me to avoid the risk of drinking and i would like to share them. maybe they help some of you folks as well working out late i make it through the day with the plan to get to the gym at or pm. after an hour of working out, when i get home and eat i am too tired to even think about drinking. playing a videogame with friends obviously that s something for the younger generation but it helps a lot. it s like a hobby sport and social acitivity at the same time. taking a walk many factors, but it helps a lot. st john s wort started taking it in december, not sure whether it s placebo or not but even the process of doing something helps. valerian helps a lot in the evenings, when stress kicks in i would normally grab a beer to chill out. sex i am monitoring my moderate drinking for more weeks when i hit years of age but as far as i can see i need to quit completely and somehow find more ways to get through the type of situations which mostly get me. anyways, i just wanted to share. and even though i am still trying to moderate and that s why i have no badge i will not drink with you today.",alcoholism

-38.220093,92.15428,"thoughts at weeks this is a reflection on what is different for me this time, and i m curious on what others think, whether not drinking is going well for you now or is as hard as hades i ve experienced the latter many times! . i ve been doing a lot of reading recently turns out there s a lot more clear headed free time when you re not drinking every night . one thing i m interested in is why this time is much easier for me than other attempts to quit. for background, i used to drink every night. almost never until blackout or losing control but a solid . bottles of wine and stiff cocktails. every single night for years with only a couple of day streaks in there. i have a good job, great family, plenty of resources, etc. drinking wasn t a problem, per se, but i was beginning to realize it was keeping me from so much more in life, both from a mental health perspective and also leading a more full and active life eg, i d let exercise disappear from my life, was napping every weekend, etc . my kids were growing up thinking it was totally normal for dad to drink three glasses of wine at brunch. and the amount i was drinking was imperceptibly creeping up over time such that it wasn t going to be long before i might have a capital p problem. one thing i read recently is that any prior attempts to quit smoking are the best indicators of ultimate future success. i don t know why this wouldn t also be true for drinking. the logic is that every attempt to quit shows some internal desire to change, that each attempt, even if it fails, builds a reservoir of learning and motivation, and that true internal motivation is a necessity for change. for , it makes sense why many people seem to have to hit rock bottom before they build that internal motivation to change and then are able to do so. and why people who go through quitting begrudgingly due to external forces eg, family, court, etc but without an internal motivation to change often struggle longer term. i suppose i was fortunate in that i got some concerning health news. it was unrelated to drinking and is instead a chronic condition that can turn relatively serious, particularly if you don t watch your health. amazingly surprisingly all of my bloodwork was totally fine despite what i d put my liver and body through for years. anyway, i needed to focus on my health and quit drinking several weeks ago. after days of terrible sleep, sweatiness, irritability, etc, i ve had no issues not drinking. in prior attempts, i d cave at the first temptation no matter how strongly i started out. but now that i have very real and deep rooted motivation to change, it is honestly easy. i can t believe i m saying that but it is true. i m much happier, i m still engaging and funny in social settings, i m working out every day, reading a ton, and overall in a much better place. and i haven t had any real desire to drink since stopping. so, i m coming around to this idea of internal motivation being a real solution for addictions. and i wonder how others might be able to create that motivation without hitting rock bottom or having some external thing like a health scare drive them to change? seems like a great treatment method if possible, at least for some people. and obviously, maintaining that motivation is paramount. if my doctor reversed course and said it was a bad diagnosis, i m not sure how easy it would remain.... this isn t meant to be definitive, suggest this works for all, or dismiss minimize any other perspectives. but it is how i ve reconciled this time for me versus several prior, genuine attempts that ended in failure. good luck to everyone with your journeys!",alcoholism

too long i ve been using this sub as a resource for the last two months i ve been on my sober journey and i can t thank you all enough. to have the human connection with tons of folks who know what it s like. i am so grateful. you are all incredible people. i ve been lurking and posting without having told my story, and feel like now is the time. this story mentions some non detailed possible triggers for some such as self harm, relapse, drug use, and sexual assault, just to give a forewarning. i can remember alcohol being present my entire life. there s a photo of me asleep holding an unopened can of beer as a baby. it was funnier then. i remember being given a jello shot on a family vacation, stealing sips of my dad s beer around the house when no one was looking. i had permission to drink a small glass of champagne at my oldest brother s wedding when i was . my brothers and cousins snuck me into a bar when i was , but no one said anything because i looked mature for my age. there was schnapps at friends parties in high school whose parents were cooler than mine, bottles of bacardi and smirnoff after prom. it wasn t much then, but it was already escalating. i had my first blackout experience after my high school graduation at . it was one of the worst, and one that i don t even like facing in my inner dialogues. when i was i got drunk with my family at a new years celebration, and it felt like a movie to me, like one of those scenes where everyone is feeling bliss and making fantastic memories and that nothing bad could ever happen. when i finally went to college, i partied a lot because you know college. it was heavy binge drinking and blackouts every weekend for a year and a half. friends ordered me drinks in bars, i felt dangerous and exciting for breaking the law. fast forward to january , i got an underage drinking citation at for having a party in our dorm room, caught by the ra s, had to pay fines, take responsible drinking courses which is a hilarious concept to me now and do community service. no police involved, but it was a wake up call for me. i quit the next day, cried to my parents about being a disappointment, and lived a strict sober see straight edge and vegan lifestyle for the next two and a half years. celebrated my th, st, and nd birthdays sober, drinking free soda at a casino, having vegan potlucks, having fun with friends. life was good. i thought. all the reasons for quitting drinking then were similar to the way annie explains why quitting is so hard in this naked mind. i continued on longing for a drink, wanting to fit in and be part of a bigger circle that seemed to have it figured out. i felt left out after the i m better than you because i don t drink sentiments wore off. i have lots of opinions on straight edge culture and how it is problematic, if anyone ever wants to listen to me rant about that. i suffered a lot in those almost three years because my sobriety wasn t done with forgiveness and compassion. it was complete and utter restriction and self righteousness. i am grateful for remembering all those sober experiences during that time, i just wish i was as self aware then as i am now. x b now as i reflect on this, i realise that i was already living the life of someone with an alcohol problem. addiction runs in my family. i ve seen it destroy my brother is world countless times before he found sobriety. my alcoholic grandfather abused my mother and her family as they grew up, my dad has a couple of beers every day. i chose sobriety then because i thought, i ll end up just like them. the scare tactics worked for a while, but i was in an unsatisfying relationship, engaged and terrified, will this be my life forever? no, i can learn to handle my alcohol i clearly hadn t learned up to this point . i was at this time and i wasn t ready to resign my life away to boring sobriety, a boring life forever. not to mention there were other issues at hand in my relationship that led me to this conclusion, but i abruptly ended my engagement and flipped my life completely on its head. i started doing drugs primarily weed, but pretty much anything i could get my hands on and binge drinking define as relapse with a new group of friends i met through my new job. i was having the time of my life, everything that was wrong in the last few years seemed to melt away. i lost a lot of old friends because of my behaviour. i don t even speak to my ex fianc anymore. i was cold and heartless and selfish. but i didn t care, i made the choice i wanted to and i numbed myself for the next five years. heavily. x b there d be intermittent waves of it all catching up to me, i d cut back, give my body a couple of week breaks here and there, but as soon as i felt better, i d go right back to the bottle and the bowl. i ve been in therapy most of my life, since about , mostly to deal with early childhood sexual assault, trauma, and growing up as a highly sensitive person with generalised anxiety and depression. i was in therapy at that time in my mid twenties, and i wonder now what my therapist thought of my substance abuse. i had never really talked about my addiction with my therapists before. we framed it in the context of quitting smoking because i smoked at the time. restriction and negative language makes your brain usually want to fight against it. saying no to cigarettes is less effective than saying, instead of smoking, i ll have a lollipop. it makes so much sense now. my therapy wasn t as successful then because i didn t let it be. i didn t want to quit all the habits that were making my life hell. i was anxious about whether or not i had a problem, but i didn t want to look at the solution, going back to my unsatisfying life of sobriety that i had chosen to leave behind. i learned a lot about myself, about how to deal with anxiety, and how to be mindful, but i wonder if he was disappointed how i d come in high already or how i drank a bottle of wine to myself the night before. i think about emailing him now, to tell him how many tools he s given me to succeed, how grateful i am, how good i m doing, but i m not sure. it makes me nervous to think about writing that email. i want to apologise to everyone i affected during this time, but i m not sure how to bring it up or if it even matters. x b there is so much of that time period i don t remember. i can t remember how i felt in general because i was in a haze almost of the time. but i remember the deep depression and anxiety. i remember a coworker saying to me, you re not an alcoholic if you haven t started day drinking . weed before work isn t a drink, so i can t be an addict. i let that be an excuse for why i continued binging in the evenings and all day on the weekends. i was drinking half a bottle of whiskey in one go, until it became drinking almost the whole bottle on a regular basis. i was getting high at literally every chance i could, on the way to work, on the way home from work, and in between drinks. but the things i do remember, the trauma caused by alcohol didn t click. the shame and guilt just weren t getting through my head that this was a problem. ex boyfriends screamed at me in public for my drinking problem, i woke up late for work and disappointed my bosses and coworkers almost daily, i picked fights with my friends and partners, i was so jealous and argumentative, i drove many times when i shouldn t have, even wrecked my car no other cars involved thank fuck i was roofied at a bar because i wasn t paying attention to my drink, i was assaulted, put in sketchy sexual situations, there were blackouts, puking, pissing the bed, passing out in public places, and i self harmed with more frequency than ever before. but i still didn t quit drinking or using drugs. x b i was completely at a loss, had finally gotten out of an abusive relationship, and started saving money to plan a big move just for some sort of change, to escape the life i had created for myself. then i met my now husband. we fell in love immediately. of course over drinks, but it was always love. i moved halfway across the world to be with him and we began our life together two years ago. the drinking didn t stop just because we were happy or in a new place. we drank more and more and held on to the bliss until it turned into deeper depressions, stupid drunken arguments, and feeling like complete and utter dog shit day after day. i had mostly quit drugs at this point, save a few parties and raves where people offered me some, but they weren t easily accessible to me anymore. i was, however, drinking beers on any given day, then could house a bottle of wine or two no problem, and once all that ran dry, we d hit the liquor bottles that somehow survived in our household for more than a few days at a time. i was shocked if there was a day of the week when i hadn t drank. it was always just about where our next drink was going to come from, can t wait to get home so i can have a drink, i m bored, want to go to the pub? i gained so much weight. i blew up like a balloon. i knew everyone knew it was because i was drinking so much. i was ashamed of my body, the walking proof that alcohol was taking over my life. i threw up at my own wedding reception because i drank too much. i blacked out at one of my husbands work events, fought with him the whole way home, then put my head through a wall, forced him to pry a knife out of my hands because i was about to self harm right there in the kitchen, and then promptly passed out in the bathtub. that somehow still wasn t the last straw. x b our last night drinking was at a club where a friends band was playing this past june. it was a typical evening, nothing special, nothing hardcore. we just got drunk, i got jealous and argumentative again, said some nasty things and after the apologies, we looked at each other just knowing it had to stop. the next morning we talked about our plan to quit drinking and we haven t looked back since. sobriety is the best decision we have ever made as a couple and for ourselves individually. it wasn t easy at first, and some days still aren t easy. i still get fomo when i hear stories about my friends having a blast tripping and getting fucked up at music festivals or thinking about how i won t ever get to drink sake in japan, but then i reach for my resources and dive in and come back sure as before, knowing that it s just not worth it and that it s one day at a time. x b since quitting alcohol, we vacationed to a new city and spent the entire trip clear headed and present, i celebrated my th birthday without a drink, socialised sober after some time regaining strength and courage, sober sex, sober love, sober dinner, sober mornings, weekends, all of it. we are both musicians and we played our first gig ever sober last month and it was such a gift to completely feel the music instead of the drink. i think about the intense joy i feel sober and that drives me forward. sure it means that i feel the bad emotions just as intensely, but i ve always been a person with big feelings, and i welcome them with acceptance and know that they will always pass. if anything in life has taught me that, it s that nothing is ever permanent except death. so until i m dead i ll work to make my life the absolute best it can be. being alive is actually joyful again. i m so grateful for a partner in this experience. we are each others support system and motivational team. we love each other just as much sober. we look forward to starting a family someday, and we are celebrating his sister is wedding with support from our families this month as well. a little note was even added in the wedding invitation, come to this pub after the ceremony for drinks or enjoy a nonalcoholic cocktail just for us. feeling love to this extreme is such a blessing and i m beyond grateful for every person who has said a positive thing to me in this journey. thank you to them and thank you for this sub, the books, podcasts, all the materials i ve kept in my tool belt for support. x b i feel like these kinds of stories are reserved for when you ve reached a long period of sobriety, but i m just so fed up with that life that i don t ever want to go back. i worry, i crave, but i m painfully aware of all the feelings that would come with a relapse. of course, i m terrified it could still happen after a long period of progress, but i can t let that get in the way of sobriety being my number priority right now. alcohol does not even appeal to me anymore. i m not ungrateful for my experiences with alcohol because they have taught me exactly what i need to face my problems now. i forgive myself for my mistakes because it was the alcohol instructing my decisions instead of my smart, capable, and compassionate sober mind. as my mom says, nothing good ever comes from drinking, and i can say that all the serious mistakes i ever made were linked with alcohol consumption. i feel stronger than ever and more sure of my decision to live an alcohol free life and really believe that i won t ever go back. x b if you made here, thank you for reading, and remember that your journey is yours alone and you re incredible for being on it. peace and love.",alcoholism

i joke about i guess i will just die on the floor that is literally what was going through my head and it was not funny at all. i just kept remembering myself from years ago, before this shit, and how cool i was. and i kept thinking about the last years and how boring i was, literally just running home to watch reruns this particularly pisses me off, not even watching something new of the time with a couple of bottles of wine and no dinner so it would kick harder, going to the gas station at in the morning because the pints i would already had were not knocking me out, whole days spent in bed swearing off booze until i could walk at pm and went to get a couple to take the edge off so i could quit tomorrow. always tomorrow. i thought about a lot more shameful stuff that i am not going to go into, things that brush against my memory and just send jolts of adrenaline fueled shame through me. it is like being the butt of a joke but not realizing it, at first i was laughing along but then i got the joke and i got angry not at first, at first i just stared into the mirror and cried a little for a few years, this time getting angry was what i needed . i have demolished relationships with people who treated me better than my best friend alcohol. is it all better today? fuck no. but it sure wo not be worse tomorrow if i can help it. nbsp thanks sd, iwndwyt",alcoholism

anything happen. will any of this be clear? as i will or maybe will not come to find out probably not to everything. you look like a fuckin whore what was that she asked i said, this night s been a fuckin bore you worthless cunt then i got slapped. not the hardest slap i ve come across but it wasn t the lightest. it would probably be best described as a nice hearty slap across the face with hints of pinky, ring finger and middle finger the most prominent note being her palm wacking me in the cheek, maybe an inch away from my temple, alerting a cut i had in my mouth to the fact that i d once again been an asshole to this bitch. whatever, fuck her anyways, she never fucking paid for drinks and was a slut. who cares. my fucking cut inside my mouth cared plenty i d recently been at a concert where people were rowdy, moshing and all that kind of mindless bullshit. some cocksucker elbowed me in the face. i tried setting the brainless fuckbag on fire but the security guards threw me the fuck out before it happened. they didn t even know what i d been through. the piles of shit and desperation that i fucking went through. i d been sitting at this piece of shit bar for at least four of five hours trying to drink and all these stupid motherfuckers kept telling me about their worthless lives. some fucking guy had a mother who didn t know what an answering machine was. every time she called, she fucking asked the thing where gary was and why this stupid slut kept picking up and asking her to leave a message. what the fuck was a message this crazy old bitch would ask. he d have to explain to her that it was a machine, and to just hang up, but the crazy slut didn t know what the fuck he was talking about. she insisted that he was cheating on his boney, uglier than fuck wife with some robotic woman. who the fuck knows how this kind of shit happens. so gary told me that he changed his answering machine to be a man s voice. this didn t appease his mother. she thought he was either gay or a criminal, with some strange man picking up his fucking phone all the time. i told him that he should probably kick her in the fuckin ribs and he gave me a weird look, the poor scumbag. i shot the same look back him and coughed some nasty shit all over the asshole s shoulder. i hoped that he would get the fuck away from me maybe try fighting me so that i could have an opportunity to hit him in the face with my pint glass only after i finished my guinness though, the fuck. he kept talking about his stupid fucking mother, jesus, what an asshole. i wished the guy would stop, maybe have a sudden onset of leprosy or ebola, but this fucking guy persevered and kept yapping like a drunk cokewhore. fuck i wanted to hit him. on and on about this woman, i m afraid that i m starting to sound like the motherfucker. he said that once and for all, he couldn t take it and drove to his mother s house and tried to explain to this poor old bitch that he was neither cheating on his wife or gay. i thought he was probably guilty of both, the fucking asshole. he told her that is was two thousand fucking nine and that there was some fucked up technology out there. that when you called someone and they didn t pick up, then that call was forwarded to something that is called an answering machine , something that records a message for the person calling if they so choose. so the stupid bitch asked to see this machine he was talking about. i told him that he should ve gotten a knife and stabbed the dumb bitch to death right about then. he tried so hard to explain that it was all digital, like mom, are you fucking retarded or something, this voice is not a human, just listen to the fuckin thing. it s a robot you stupid bitch. he probably didn t say that because he was a braindead pussy who needed a pair of balls sewed to his body. he probably looked at her like a meek piece of shit, with a bewildered and slightly bemused look gracing his face. his tiny brain trying to process the immense amount of retardation that was transpiring in front of him. so he told me that he kept trying to explain himself to this woman that was his mom, but too fucking stupid to understand what an answering machine was. i would ve fucking lost it. even though that essentially denotes i have something to lose, which i don t think that i do, whateverthefuck that i might have or might have had, it would have been gone and flying somewhere during a conversation with this lady. i probably would ve dropped dead. maybe i would ve gotten some scissors and cut her tongue out. in all likelihood i would ve gotten on the internet, ordered an old answering machine the kind everyone had in the s from fucking ebay, waited until the piece of shit showed up at my house, went over there and beat that woman the fuck to death with an answering machine. there would be no fucking way she would still be unacquainted with answering machines at that point. fuck, that would certainly teach her a lesson she wouldn t soon forget. who knows what kind of shit you remember when you re dead though. so i asked the guy what the fuck happened to his dumbfuck mother and his shitty answering machine story. he told me that she was in the hospital three blocks away dying or some bullshit like that. i could tell he wanted someone to talk to, so despite the desperate urge to kick him in the throat, i asked him what was wrong with this presumably old bitch. he said that she had overdosed on some fucking drug or another, probably another streetwalking junkie whore, sucking

7.827659,26.1493,"days present and accounted for. years sober. a few words on my journey. august , i made the most deliberate, impactful change of my life. i committed to stop drinking alcohol. i had thought about quitting many times before. some halfway seriously and others merely fleeting wishes. this time was the first time i would truly go all in. i was staring into my own abyss....who do i want to be? is this the life i want to live? it was not. i was ready. by ready, i mean i was willing to do whatever it took to get over this compulsive behavior of consuming a poison that was harming me. if the answer was that i had to believe the easter bunny was real and he was the only one who could help me, i was ready to believe. i was finally willing to do whatever it took. in my early twenties i had started to consider that maybe my life would be better off without alcohol in it. i would write to myself to drink less. less amounts when i drank and less frequency of nights drinking. it was not effective i drank too much and too frequently. i would live my life with this gnawing urge to drink. looking forward to the next occasion. it was an itch that could never be scratched though. i was never satisfied. it always felt like the next time i drank, that would be the satisfaction i was looking for. but it was completely illusive, it was a mirage, it did not exist. on nights of heavy drinking where i would consume well into the is of drinks, it always felt like the next one would be satisfying. it never was. it was a black hole that was impossible to be filled. it is hard to come to terms with your drinking in our society if you are not thinking completely independently. plenty of people will attempt to convince you that there is nothing wrong. they do not know what it feels like inside or how strong your urges are. they only see the exterior of your life. i have never been arrested and i am extremely lucky and fortunate that nothing ever really that bad happened as a result of my drinking. as if the absence of completely ruining your life from alcohol makes drinking a ok. i have come to see over the last years that we in america have a really fucked up relationship with alcohol....it is the only drug where you have to explain why you do not do it. wa not a beer? no thanks, i do not drink. why???? you are expected to explain why you do not use this particular drug that society has deemed necessary for social gathering. you are expected to participate in consuming a mind altering drug that destroys the lives of many people a year, whether by silent misery or by overtly killing them. alcohol is a destructive force that does viscous damage if you open your eyes and see the reality. you almost certainly know someone whose life it has seriously fucked up. but that was not me. on the surface i was holding it together...even successful . but what it was doing was stealing my potential. stealing any joy or peace. stealing my life from me and preventing me from being the person i wanted to be. i regularly woke up and was disgusted with my behavior. i was betraying my own principles. i was wasting my one opportunity to live a deliberate life the way i wanted to, to be the person i wanted to be. to behave in a manner that was worthy of my own self respect. if you are not an alcoholic, you have no idea how difficult it is to manage your desires and cravings. it grows throughout the years. it is a progressive disease as they say. by the end, such a major part of my mental bandwidth was being consumed on managing my desire to drink or actually doing it, planning it, etc. what a fucking albatross. moving on felt like losing lbs. moving on was not easy. it is scary because the success rate that you hear is not very good. so, i am faced with knowing that i want to quit alcohol more than anything, and i am completely willing to do whatever it takes to get there, but i am scared that i wo not be able to do it. once again, i am extremely lucky for things. x b . my older brother had quit years prior. i got to witness firsthand the positive changes he made in his life. it was amazing and inspiring to witness. it showed me how worthless alcohol is... he removed it from his life and there was no downside only upside. i love situations like that so sign me up. . the welcoming people at aa. i am not an aa person, i do not go to meetings with any regularity a year maybe , and that is only because of me and my lack of patience and boredom. i would likely be a much better person if i went regularly. but the fact is that when i was willing to do whatever it takes i went to aa hardcore. i did my meetings in days and i got a sponsor and worked the steps. my sponsor was an amazing guy, he saw me pretty much sobbing to myself in the second meeting i attended. i have lost touch with him, but i will be forever grateful for him helping me through early sobriety. he showed me how to do it and heard my th step in his basement, had me over for dinner with his family. unbelievable generosity and kindness. thank you. . my wife has been supportive the whole time. she even does not ever drink when i am present. i have never asked this of her, she just decided that she wanted to do that. she has amazing social grace, and i have always been more of an introvert... making the decision to not drink ostracizes you a bit further from society especially in social gatherings where alcohol is present. she has never made me feel bad about this. i appreciate her help. i am confident that no matter what i eventually would have found my way to sobriety, but the factors above i think contributed to me getting there sooner. and thank goodness, because i would not have wanted to waste any more time drinking. that is how i look at it, wasted time. they say in aa you will not regret the past or wish to shut the door on it . i have not gotten there yet. i do regret the past. i wish i could do it over. i know i could have been a much better athlete at the very least, but i digress. ultimately, i guess it is not important and it is just part of my life. i am happy now. happier than i have ever been. i worry about my children having the same relationship with alcohol that i did. i mentioned my brother, but alcoholism in my family runs deep. i do not have contact with many relatives because my parents and grandparents and almost all of my relatives are deceased. but i do know that alcoholism played a role in many of their deaths. it is a fucking terrible drug. i hope that my children can either decide to never drink or miraculously drink normally . it is definitely a concern of mine though. i know how many incredibly dangerous and awful positions i put myself in while drinking over the years. the last thing i would like to say is if you are on the fence about quitting, please feel free to talk to me. dm me here. or go to a meeting. people would love to help you. you can always go back to drinking. but life moves quick....i have been drunk and i have been sober...sober is better. quitting drinking can be a mysterious venture. the big book of aa describes a lot of people who have been through it. read it. if i tried to white knuckle my way to quitting alcohol, i would have failed. and been miserable trying. alcohol is very powerful over the mind of anyone who has alcoholic tendencies. i had to completely submit. i had to admit that i am powerless over alcohol . that is when the healing started. i do not believe in a lot of the aa dogma, but there is a ton of wisdom in the foundational info. good luck on your journey.",alcoholism

9.651795,21.39385,"extreme debilitating anxiety at night when trying to sleep i desperately need help dealing with my current situation and am really hoping that someone on this site can help me as i have nowhere else to turn. one year ago april i had a lot of work to do over the weekend i am an it project manager and work remotely from my home , but i blew it off and decided to go to bed really early on sunday night so that i could wake up early monday morning to do it. however that night i ended up tossing and turning for close to hours because i was anxious about the work that i did not do and did not know what high priority emails had come up that i was blowing off and worried that i would not have enough time in the morning to get through everything before my day started. at close to or in the morning i ended up getting up and just doing the work, and i ended up working through the late night hours until it was bright outside and time to start my official work day am . a few weeks after that night the same thing happened again i had unfinished work that i did not do and wanted to just do the next morning before work but again, my brain would not let me go to sleep because i was nervous about the unfinished work not getting done in the morning. since that night, my life has been completely and utterly taken over by my anxiety and it has spiraled out of control. since last april, i would estimate that this happens to me times a week on average. though it started as a way for me to protect myself from the consequences if i did not do all of my work, it has snowballed into something completely irrational and out of my control. now if i leave so much as email in either my personal email or work email not responded to, i wo not be able to fall asleep at night and will toss and turn for hours until i finally give up and get up to do it. i find myself reading and re reading my to do list for the next day over and over and over again many times to make sure that i have done everything on it that i possibly can do even if something is not due for another week , because if there is something on it that i could have done today then i wo not be able to sleep. it has taken over every aspect of my work, personal life, and social life. at this point when i go to bed at night i accept the fact that there is a high likelihood that i wo not able to fall asleep for hours and will end up getting up, working, and then not going to bed until or in the morning whether it is during the week or a weekend. the bandaid solution that i started to use after it started last spring was to make sure that i got all of my work done so that i would be able to fall asleep i used this as a form of prevention and protection for myself. but as you can see from the paragraph above, this form of protection for myself has completely and utterly snowballed out of control and taken over my life in a major way. now i have found that even if i have done of all possible things for the day that i could have done, my mind still finds small, random things to keep me up. i create unnecessary deadlines for myself feeling like even if something is due next week, that i need to get it done today in order to have the peace of mind to be able to fall asleep that night. even if i literally have nothing that i could possibly do, i am so scared of the many miserable sleepless nights that i have had tossing and turning and crying for close to hours, that if it has been mins without me being able to fall asleep, i get worried that it will turn into another am night, which makes me freaked out and feel like the cycle is going to happen again which of course does make it actually happen, except this time there is no work that i can do to alleviate the situation and allow me to finally sleep. this has extended into other aspects of my life health another behavioral outcome of this is that i find myself constantly picking my lip when i am anxious which is now pretty much all the time . and i got blood work done recently and my cortisol levels are . x the normal levels, indicating that my body is under high levels of stress and is under attack. i have tried so many different types of treatment acupuncture, seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist, medical marijuana, cbd, fixing microbiome in my gut since there is strong evidence of evidence cause from issues with your gut brain connection , meditation have taken two week classes , and i take a number of natural supplements targeted to help with stress anxiety ashwaghanda, magnesium, l thealine . as you can see i am trying to explore any and all solutions before turning to medication, which is a last resort that i would really prefer not to need to do. most recently i have started doing one on one sessions with my meditation teacher to work on ifs inter family systems therapy. it is a really really cool therapy where you understand yourself to be made up of different protectors or parts , each with a unique role to protect you and lookout for you in some way however these protectors overtime can misinterpret their role and begin to take on a new form so though they believe that what they are doing is helping you, they are actually hurting you because they have taken their role to an extreme which is clearly what is happening to me . so the idea behind the therapy is to retrain these parts to actually help you in the way that you intend. i really like the idea of this therapy and think that it has a lot of potential, but i have been working on it for weeks now and have made no progress and found no relief. at this point i am desperate for other ideas or people to weigh in. i am curious if anyone has dealt with anything similar or if you have any suggestions or ideas for next steps that i should explore. and at this point, as much as i hate to say it, i am definitely open to considering medication as well. sorry for the essay, but i thought it was important to share all of the context on my situation. it would be nice to know if i am alone on these feelings experiences or not.",anxiety

4.8432174,30.330025,"the anxious mind meditations on dating you might find the reflections in this post useful in the dating scene, particularly for curbing negative thoughts and emotions. what i would like to do is share one personal success story . i will share a little about what actually happened, and then break down my post analysis. this post is not really about helping you improve your dating skills. i am no pickup artist, in that regard. instead, it is about helping you better think about dating. and in a manner that will reinforce your self esteem, self respect, confidence and sense of purpose. x b the real insight is found in my post analysis. it helped me uncover new and meaningful perspectives, both on this particular date and dating in general . the conclusions i reached followed from a well informed, rational argument built on a very specific foundation. and that foundation is meaning. so if you do not agree with me on meaning in life , then you might not actually find this post helpful. if what i find meaningful though resonates with you, then you just might. i believe that my essence is love, and that this essence transcends me. personally, i find it meaningful to gift others with acts of loving kindness. and i suspect i am not the only one. it is meaningful to me, in that it boosts my self esteem and self respect. and, more than likely, it is also meaningful to the recipient. x b with that in mind, i will now summarize what actually happened date . i will also comment on what i was thinking or feeling in the moment. and, later, i will contrast that with my post analysis findings. in many cases, the contrast is quite stark. this was a first date, so i was understandably quite nervous. in fact, i was very nervous! this is someone i worked with, so we would already interacted a bit in the office. eventually, i would mustered up the courage to suggest we meet up for drinks, but the date kept getting pushed back for one reason or another. and, of course, this just gave me more time to ruminate on my anxieties. alas, though, we confirmed a date. x b we ended up grabbing drinks at a local bar, on a wednesday night. in full, i think we stayed there about minutes. the first minutes was a little bit awkward. i should mention that we had an excuse for meeting up, so it was not technically a date. i did know she recently became single though, and she would given off quite a number of signals. the excuse was for me to give her some specific business owner tips. she expressed interest earlier in potentially starting her own business someday, so it seemed as good an excuse as any to get a drink together. i started by going into a short monologue on how i think about being a business owner. of course, it was too well prepared and it probably sounded like i was reading off a teleprompter. she cut me off about minute in, and asked started asking some relevant questions. i answered maybe questions, and it then became obvious that she was not actually that interested in the topic. this threw me off a bit, of course. and i was immediately, and involuntarily, bombarded with a series of emotions that left me feeling a bit frustrated and confused. why did she want to meetup, then? the answer seems obvious to me now, but in my state of anxiety it was not. i think, like most people, i tend to be more defensive when i am anxious or nervous. and i tend to identify more with the thoughts my unconscious mind presents to me than i probably should. but that is not her fault. in some sense, it is my fault. and it is something for me to work on. at the time, i decided to just do what i do best. i started asking her an endless series of questions about herself. it is the easiest thing to do, really. and, from there, we went on to have a cordial conversation for another hour or so. x b there were a few things that frustrated me about this experience. first, she was constantly darting her eyes around from the onset, as if she was more interested in what was over my shoulder than engaging me. at the time, this made me feel self conscious and unworthy of her attention. and, in my paranoia, i suspected she might be embarrassed to be seen with me. again, this seems absurd in retrospect, but it is what i felt at the time. it is a though my unconscious mind pushed into my conscious awareness. and it is a thought i choose to resonate with, as if it was me . i also noticed, during our time together, that she openly yawned on several occasions. granted, this was at the tail end of a hour day for her, but of course that did not occur to me at the time. instead, i felt like i was not entertaining her. and i got more self conscious and frustrated. i asked her at one point if i was boring her , and sarcastically remarked that i would try not to take it personally. but i do not think i concealed my annoyance very well. at the end of the night, we parted our separate ways. i said goodbye . she said goodnight , but i do not think i returned the gesture. x b after our meet up, i felt very self conscious. i wondered to myself how i could have performed better. was i not as funny as she would have liked me to be? was i not sexually flirtatious enough? was i not confident enough? cool enough? i pondered to myself, why am i not the person she wanted me to be? what is wrong with me? x b eventually, i decided to reason from truths facts instead of involuntary thoughts. i decide to employ my conscious mind, rather than take orders from my unconscious mind. i acknowledged that my unconscious mind had served me well, for many years. it is protected me from real threats from real dangers. but i would further empowered it in my youth puberty , through no fault of my own. since then, it is been protecting me from irrational threats. and it is been barraging me with self destructive thoughts and emotions. i am not these thoughts, of course. i am the observer , and so are you. but, in the heat of the moment, i often forget this. and then my thoughts own me. of course, i do not blame my unconscious mind. it is not evil ! it is simply responding to incentives. for years, i have tuned in to its many channels. and i have ruminated on its many narratives. but, of course, it is aware of that. and so it continues to deliver more of what i seemingly want. is not that just good business? x b but facts trump fiction. that is always the case. and there is nothing more factual than the emotions the passions. if you do not believe me, try shoving a knife into your abdomen. and tell me the pain is not factual is not real . arguably, there is nothing more real. it is real to you, as you subjectively experience it. the same goes for meaning. there is hardly anything more real more true to me than love. and there is nothing more certain than the fulfilment that comes with an act of loving kindness. there is no proof, of course. but this is not science it is subjective experience. x b upon reflection, it seemed reasonable to me that if i could construct a rational argument with this truth love at it is foundation, i could reason in a highly persuasive manner. and it seemed that this method of reasoning might be more persuasive than an argument derived from some fleeting thought, pressed on me by the unconscious mind. the former line of reasoning follows from a certainty fact . the latter line of reasoning does not. and, again, that certainty is the meaningfulness of love, and acts of loving kindness, in my own life. i speak of it as a subjective truth . i know it because i feel it, and no further explanation is needed. it is meaningful to me because i say it is. x b so where does my reasoning post analysis take me, from this foundation? the first thing i recalled was the meaning purpose of my attending this date . selfishly, i admit, i did it for me. that might seem counter intuitive, considering that i find meaning in gifting acts of loving kindness. after all, is not such an act selfless ? in truth, though, i have realized that if you want to become the selfless person you aspire to be, you have to get selfish first. you have to focus on yourself, namely bettering yourself, if you are going to better help others. x b i would suggest the same mindset for you, when you are out in the dating world . do not go out on a first date for someone else. do it for yourself. do it for the meaning you will derive from the experience. if you have the opportunity to impart acts of loving kindness, then it is likely you have made that experience meaningful for your date as well. if that person is not of your essence , then they probably are not a good match for you anyway. so who cares? x b make it your mission, in dating, to make each date meaningful. and suddenly it wo not be about looking cool . suddenly it wo not be about making the right moves. it will be about making the experience meaningful, ideally for you and your date. it is hard to be someone you are not, but it is easy to be your essence. it is easy to impart acts of loving kindness to show genuine interest, kindness, humility, empathy. in fact, it is the easiest thing you can do. it is the authentic you. x b when i reflected on this, it suddenly occurred to me that i did make our date meaningful. i demonstrated a sincere interest in her life story, and i continually asked follow up questions. in truth, i was not trying to impress her. i asked more questions because i wanted to. i was genuinely curious, and i wanted to hear more. that conversation gave me numerous opportunities to add value , by offering encouragement and empathizing with her pains. and while i was flustered earlier by my thoughts, i quickly detached from them. i consciously looked for more opportunities to add value . and it was not because i thought she might find that meaningful, though she likely did. it was because i found it meaningful. i did it for me. upon reflection, it again boosted my confidence and self respect. i was a man on a mission, and that mission was meaningful to me , regardless of the outcome. x b earlier, my unconscious mind suggested to me that i was unworthy or undeserving . it suggested to me that she would suddenly, and unexpectedly, lost interest. and, in the moment, i resonated with those thoughts. they owned me. when the evening ended, i took those thoughts home with me. i would have ruminated on them all weekend, had nothing stopped me. and that would have led to self destructive behavior drinking, etc. , to drown out my misery. but when i ruminated on loving kindness, my perspective suddenly shifted. i became aware, once again, of the night is purpose. it was not to be who she wants me to be. it was to be who i wanted to be who i aspired to be. and i was demonstrably successful. i could not have come off as more thoughtful, humble, concerned and empathetic. i could not have been more authentic. if she was looking for an uber flirtatious date, that is not me. if she was looking for someone cooler , that also is not me. my intention was to be myself to be authentic not to put on a facade in an attempt to impress her. if she is not impressed with who i am, then so be it. i am not there to impress her i am there to impress myself. x b suddenly, i feel self assured. earlier, i pondered to myself, why am i not the person she wants me to be? now, i ponder to myself, why is she not the person i want her to be? i know who i am, but what about her? what about her apparent initial lack of interest? what about her dismissal of my monologue? what about the wandering eyes or the yawning? immediately, i experienced a flood of new perspectives. what if she is still interested, and she was just exhausted at the tail end of a hour work day? might that also explain the yawning? i also listened to her talk about a number of stressful things in her life. could those not weigh in? and what if her eyes were wandering simply because she was nervous? if that were the case, then i should not feel hurt i should feel compassion. after all, my eyes certainly wander when i am nervous. so could i have been wrong all along? and where did those earlier thoughts come from? x b earlier, i pondered to myself what is wrong with me? but i realize there is nothing wrong with me. i was precisely who i wanted to be me. and my behavior was purpose driven. if anything, i now ponder to myself what is wrong with her? but i do not ponder that in a judgemental or hurtful manner. i ponder it with genuine interest and concern. and i wonder aloud if there is something i could do to help. i also reflect on my expectations and what i was hoping for. who did i want her to be? if she is not that person, then it is not to be. but was it not a meaningful experience? was it not excellent practice that will help me on future dates? x b so i realize my earlier conclusions were fear driven. my more recent conclusions are grounded in love. and they are the conclusions that are meaningful to me, because they reflect an intrinsic truth . they reflect something i can know with far greater certainty than the accuracy of my fleeting passions. the arguments i reason, on these grounds, are more convincing. they might not be more convincing to you, but they are more convincing to me. and that is all that matters. if they are convincing, then i can believe them. and when i believe i should feel confident, i do feel confident. when i believe i should feel self respect, i do feel self respect. and i feel these things on my own terms. x b i also realize that, in truth, she did not emotionally hurt me. i hurt me. i self imposed my own emotional suffering, when i choose to resonate with fleeting thoughts and emotions. instead, i can choose to resonate with the truth. and, upon reflection, i can build up a rational argument that will persuade me. i can discover new perspectives that are actually meaningful to me, and that motivate me. those perspectives are aspirational, not defeating. and they reinforce my sense of purpose, along with my self esteem, self respect and confidence. x b x b x b x b x b x b",anxiety

-64.42142,-8.630649,"i need some advice help empathy.. so terrified hi everyone... this is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. i just thought it may be helpful to hear the opinions of what is going on with me as i have had a terrifying past days it all started on my birthday actually on sunday. on saturday night i went on a massive binge drinking episode to celebrate my birthday.. i couldnt tell you how much i drank. i was having a good time, but i felt depressed when i realized half the people i invited to hang out that night were not going to show up. of course, the depression got worse the more i drank. i ended up staying up til am on sunday, throwing up most of the morning. also, i have been on a restrictive diet for the past two weeks.. eating calories a day, and that day i did not eat as much because i knew i would be drinking. i have had issues with binge drinking before on the weekends, and i have had to lessen the past few weeks. however, the past weeks my caffeine intake has been in an exorbitant amounts. anyways, on sunday, after i woke up from my throwing up shitty sleep, i felt tired but fine.. and really happy that it was my birthday. it wasnt til around pm i started feeling really sick when me and my husband and his in laws were out at dinner. i attributed it to the massive drinking the night before, but this old awful familiar feeling came over me i had a horrifying panic attack in april that seemed to be induced by marijuana, it was so awful it lasted for hours and i went to the er for it . we were at dinner in a public restaurant, so i told my husband i had to go to the car because i felt sick. the waves of panic started coming in. i tried calming myself down, but i ended up having a panic attack. it was a minute drive to our house, but i ended up calming down thanks to him. i felt weird at our house.. almost like i was in a dream, but felt much better. i almost fell asleep until i saw a weird face i have read that when you fall asleep, your mind often creates hallucinogenic images.. is that right? and that sent me into a panic again. my mom actually has psychosis and anxiety as well, so i thought i was turning into my mom with the psychosis this same feeling happened to me the first time i had my panic attack too . ever since then, which was on sunday night, i have just been feeling depersonalized and scared to leave the house. im scared to look at the sky in fear that im going to see something strange and then it will trigger panic. then it got so bad that i didnt want to even go outside. i took one atavin that was prescribed to me when i had the initial panic attack in april, but it just made me feel weird for a while like high and then i got more panicked eventually. i eventually calmed down on sunday night and went to sleep, and thought id be fine by the morning. however, i tried to go to work yesterday, but i only ended up staying for minutes because i was going to freak out any minute and i was having severe depersonalization with anyone i interacted with i interact with people all day long... i went to a behavioral health urgent care clinic yesterday where a doctor prescribed me xanax just for the panic attacks, and buspirone half a pill twice a day to help with the general anxiety. he thinks he drinking led on the panic attacks. however, i felt like a complete insane total mess, like if i was not having panic anxiety attacks i was cataonically depressed. yesterday there were a few moments in which i was sort of ok, but overall i would say sunday monday were the scariest days of my life because i felt so out of control. today has gotten a little better, as i have found methods to cope with my anxiety breaths in, breaths out . i also started doing jumping jacks anytime i feel a wave of panic. i dont think the buspirone is actually helping because i keep getting like a half hour of pure anxiety, and then another hour of being severely depressed, then an hour of feeling slightly normal. this has been the cycle all day. i took one xanax yesterday when i was having a panic attack before bed, but it just zonked me out. im not sure if it actually worked. im here tonight.. anticpating possibly going into work tomorrow i called off yesterday and today but i am so terrified of the depersonalization again. it is making me so sad to not look at my husband see him as someone i love.. but a stranger.. and then i get freaked out. does anyone think i actually have generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder, or is this just my body adjusting to the binge drinking no sleep poor nutrition? my thoughts seem a lot clearer today, while im suffering from the brutal waves of anxiety, im not as panicked about seeing weird things in the sky.. i just want to know that im going to get better. i left the house a couple times today and was feeling ok then would start getting panicked after like minutes. im actually also scared of going to sleep as well. i dont want to take the xanax again tonight because im just afraid it may be making the depersonalization worse. will it get better.. do i need to go inpatient treatment for this? i am going to try and see if i can get a counseling appt asap, but most likely need something more immediate if i dont feel better by tomorrow. so sorry for the long post.. tldr i have been having horrible panic attacks terror anxiety depersonalization for days now after a day of binge drinking.",anxiety

the part that makes it so i can t fall asleep even now. k is very strong, and doesn t like admitting defeat, even to her own anxiety. to her that means going about her life as normally as possible she doesn t want anyone to coddle her or pity her. of course, i respect this, and didn t stop her from coming along with me and a few of my friends last night to dinner. she was so very distant and quiet. the whole time one of my buddies was pulling me aside and saying things like k seems really sad tonight is everything okay?

7.0809283,26.845879,"how to suffer less and live more a practical, science based approach it is well known that thoughts create emotions. but the full consequences of this fact are largely misunderstood. thoughts create emotions, those emotions guide our behavior. for example, the thought i m never going to succeed at school, why should i even study? creates emotional distress. that emotional distress can easily trigger coping behaviors like binge watching house of cards or mindlessly refreshing instagram every five seconds. that s just the beginning of the spiral, though. after you ve been binge watching tv or staring at your cell phone for an hour, you re going to have a new thought, damn, i shouldn t have wasted an hour on my phone, i m so stupid, i ll never pass that class. this thought creates more emotional distress, which leads to more coping behavior, i ll watch just one more episode or, i ll click just one more link on facebook . but wait a minute! shouldn t the thought i shouldn t have wasted an hour on my phone, i m so stupid, i ll never pass that class, help motivate you to study? isn t calling yourself out in an honest way helpful? don t you have to fight your way out of stress? if we were completely logical creatures, you d be right. our thoughts don t directly lead to behaviors, they create emotions which lead to behaviors. this creates a trap that is exceedingly easy for us to fall into. the first step in this example is the thought, i should be studying right now. this creates the sense that we aren t being productive enough, that we are screwing up and the emotion we feel because of this thought isn t motivation, but distress. what do humans do when they feel distressed? cope. what are the most common coping behaviors used in st century life? electronic media, food, and drugs. this is a counterintuitive idea, but it has very important implications. in her best selling book, the upside of stress, psychologist kelly mcgonigal writes when i speak with physicians, i sometimes ask them to predict the effects of showing smokers graphic warnings on cigarette packs. in general, they believe that the images will decrease smokers desire for a cigarette and motivate them to quit. but studies show that the warnings often have the reverse effect. the most threatening images say, a lung cancer patient dying in a hospital bed actually increase smokers positive attitudes toward smoking. the reason? the images trigger fear, and what better way to calm down than to smoke a cigarette? the doctors assumed that the fear would inspire behavior change, but instead it just motivates a desire to escape feeling bad. this pattern is a lot like psychological quicksand. as soon as we have a negative thought like i should be studying or i shouldn t be eating this pint of delicious cherry garcia ice cream , our instinct to fight it gives that negative thought more emotional charge. that emotional charge is expressed as an increased feeling of distress, which makes us think even more negatively, and before long, our head is beneath the sand and we re suffocating from what was originally just a relatively benign negative thought. nbsp break free nbsp so, negative thoughts create negative emotions, which lead to negative behaviors, which create negative i should be doing something else thoughts, which create more negative emotions, and so on. this is an extremely frustrating pattern that can easily determine our behaviors and the quality of our emotional life. the solution isn t to learn how to think more positively, nor is it to learn how to control your emotions. the solution is much more obvious than the traditional approaches, yet it is also more elusive. to escape the vicious cycle of negative thought, you must accept the negative thought as it is. in quicksand, to stop sinking, you must stop fighting it and be still with the quicksand. similarly, with negative thoughts, you must learn to compassionately accept them as they are. once you learn to accomplish this effectively, you will still have negative thoughts, but they will drift away like clouds on a gentle breeze instead of darkening into a storm of emotional suffering. the root of our suffering is our belief that we can or even should eliminate negative thoughts and emotional pain. the thought that suffering is bad or negative is itself a negative thought. this way of thinking makes stress a trigger for more stress. to escape this spiral of stress and suffering that we get trapped in, we must learn to relate to our thoughts differently. modern psychologists have developed effective strategies to accomplish this. in acceptance and commitment therapy, cognitive fusion is a state in which we become entangled with our thoughts and we lose the ability to distinguish between thoughts and objective reality. author russ harris says, in a state of fusion a thought can seem like . the absolute truth . a command you have to obey or a rule you have to follow. the solution to cognitive fusion is learning cognitive defusion, this is where we can observe our thoughts and see them for what they are just products of our busy minds. there are numerous strategies that help us achieve cognitive defusion. here i m going to focus on one that is both easy to use and highly effective. labeling is a mindfulness technique that allows us to defuse from our thoughts, it helps us identify our thoughts as subjective opinions instead of objective facts. i recommend practicing labeling as a dedicated daily meditation practice minutes to start , this will help you build it into a natural thought habit. nbsp how to practice labeling nbsp either during a sitting meditation or any time throughout the day, notice your thoughts. for example, you might notice you have the thought, i don t want to be meditating right now, i have more important things to do, to label this thought simply tell yourself, i am having the thought that i don t want to be meditating right now. if you are having the thought, i am too tired to work right now, label it by telling yourself, i am having the thought that i am too tired to work right now. labeling also works with sensations and emotions, for example, i am having the sensation of tightness in my neck, or i am having the feeling of anxiety. the practice is fairly uncomplicated, and making it into a thought habit won t take long of course the more you practice this during dedicated meditation, the more you will naturally label your thoughts in your day to day life . labeling won t eliminate your negative thoughts or emotional pain, nor should it. the point of labeling is learning to become aware of your thoughts so that pain does not need to become suffering. have your efforts to eliminate negative thoughts or emotional pain ever panned out? after years of struggling against pain has it become clear that the traditional approach of coping through escapism or self punishment doesn t work? maybe fighting pain just creates more pain. experiment with this technique and notice if it affects how you relate to your thoughts. do they become louder or quieter, more invasive or easier to manage? you may find that once you start to create distance from your thoughts without trying to change them , that they affect you less. you may notice that you still have the thought, i m never going to succeed in school, there s no point in studying, and that thought may still be painful, but now the thought isn t you it s just a thought, and the pain is just pain. you may notice that you are now able to accept stress as something that happens, and now you can experience it without needing to avoid it through coping. you may notice that now your thoughts and pain no longer spiral into stress and suffering. as a result, the quicksand doesn t suck you in, you re able to surrender to it, and you can finally be free. for more, go to",anxiety

-76.92007,-4.9156656,"i m so afraid of being dumb my biggest fear in life is being dumb. i ve convinced myself that intelligent people have a higher capacity for fulfillment and that having limited intelligence means limited happiness. and there s no way i can convince myself otherwise because everything around me suggests i m right. general intelligence allows people to approach situations with competence. school is the obvious area where intelligence plays a role. and how well a person does in school affects their career later on. people argue that plenty of successful people didn t do well in school but went on to successful careers, but they re ignoring the fact that smart people can do poorly in school, but that they need that intelligence to propel them professionally. but even in our personal lives intelligence is necessary for enjoyment. watching a tv show requires the ability to follow a narrative, at the very least. but so much more enjoyment comes from being able to predict what happens, or having the empathy to really relate to characters which requires being able to take a situation that is unfamiliar and draw enough connections to create an emotional understanding . music requires intelligence to decipher lyrics and track the progression of our favorite artists as they evolve and change styles. friendship requires empathy and the ability to have a conversation, and no one wants to talk too much with the person who has no original ideas. i find that every area of my life would be better if only i were smart enough. but i consistently find that i fall short of the mark. i do terribly in school because i dont have the memory to retain information, but more than that i don t have the ability to make connections that make that information meaningful. i can hear things and repeat them at a basic level but i don t know that i really understand it, and i certainly can t use it to enhance the world around me and create new styles of thinking for myself. i never feel intellectually engaged. and so i don t have a distinct personality which makes me a boring person to talk to, because anything i say could be said by someone else with more meaning and authenticity. i m a funny person but all my jokes rely on shock value. i m not good with social cues another probable symptom of low intelligence so i am more easily able to say things that other people find surprising. but the jokes themselves aren t clever. there s nothing unique about them. and i d be fine not having many friends if i had a rich inner life. but as i mentioned above, watching movies shows or listening to music is hard because none of it means anything to me. i don t make connections and my lack of empathy prevents me from being engaged with any of the characters. i just feel completely disengaged with the world, but i m surrounded by all these people who manage to get something out of it. i feel like everyone i meet is smarter than i am. i wish i could blame it on depression or anxiety but i ve been feeling this way as long as i can remember, before i ever felt depressed or anxious, and all the depressed anxious people i meet still seem to have the ability to think. to this end, i ve spent so much time trying to find some sort of physiological cause beneath my brain fog, as i ve been calling it for years. i spent three months being obsessively gluten free because i thought i had celiac. and that whole time i was so happy because i thought i had an answer. but it turned out i was wrong and that my anxiety was creating the symptoms around my expectations and desires . so i started thinking i had vitamin deficiencies, or a tumor, or any number of things that i could possibly connect back to impaired cognition. i recognize now that it was all anxiety but it means i have to confront the fact that i might be this way forever. it ll always get in my way and prevent me from reaching any kind of happiness or fulfillment. i don t want to live my whole life feeling disengaged and incompetent and beneath everyone else. and i don t want to keep walking around so viciously self aware of it all. i m not suicidal, but i m very very tired.",anxiety

-78.21044,-3.8043215,"my struggles with life as an year old. hello everyone, i thought about posting this for months and i decided to do it right now. so i am just a year old person from middle east bahrain to be exact and nothing more really. for years, i have been struggling with several problems over my life. to start with, i did have some minor adhd as a kid although i managed to deal with it fairly well and i also started talking a bit later than usual kids but that is not what i want to talk about. my main problem started with school life and how i was bullied a lot especially after going from a private school to government one. i was being mocked and laughed at, got attacked by people several times and fake rumors started spreading around. i tend to get angry a lot back in the day and sometimes caused a massive chaos around the school. i used to have a lot of friends in my life but right now i have next to null. even my only friend in real life barely talks to me anymore. i started losing and losing friends due to that and plus the fact they seems to moved on due to their newer interest. i always felt out of place and even more so in the recent years. i started feeling lonely and have low self esteem, started getting jealous on how others seems to be happy and enjoying life while i am just there sitting alone with no one to talk to. plenty seems to never understand me and i always feel nervous talking to anyone. i am struggling to make any new friends over here. my family were not always that nice to me, not saying they are bad or anything but sometimes they seems to not care or understand my struggles. as of the moment, i am just spending my entire week barely leaving home with no one to spend time with. everyone else seems to be enjoying their life while i am crying every night at the bed about how life sucks and sometimes having suicidal thoughts. i tried to spend my time more on the internet and maybe meet new people with same interest and enjoy my time but again, it feels even harder to do so especially since they are from completely different background. i spent more time talking to foreigners than locals because i always wanted to do that but then i realized how hard it is to connect to them and ended up feeling even more out of place. it does not help how plenty seems to hate me due to my ethnic background. i always had a hard time talking to others since i barely understand their culture nor they do understand mine. it is a struggle to see people easily talk and have fun while you got...nothing to say at all. i sometimes take a lot of time just to type a small and simple line. oh and did i mention discrimination? because it is and yet this is still alive to this very day. every then and now, i hear people hating me for being backward or barbaric ...etc. often associating me to hating lgbt, west, women and...etc of mainstream media crap. i even met those sort of people while on a vacation somewhere in europe. like people wants me to be dead despite i never harmed anyone in my life and always wanted to help others. the thing that makes matters worse is that i am actually a bisexual and since i am also an arab and muslim at the same time, i feel like everyone is going to reject me for one reason or another. ether being homophobic is, islamophobic is or anti arab. i do not think anyone cares about me at all or they care about being dead. i complained several times about my depression but all i hear from people is people have much more problems and you complain about silly problems? pfft . i always feel guilty about this and makes me feel down a lot more. why bother with people anyways if no one could care less about me? i mean it is not like it is gonna improve or anything..it is not like i gonna have a future at all. why bother with life if you feel so reject and out of place, have a hard time dealing with people due to your social awkwardness and always feel sad and depressed everyday. i am talking meds for several months but i do not see it helping me that much even after changing it. thanks for reading and i hope you all have a great day.",depression

6.7876077,27.429573,"my life right now so i am at the end of my rope. it is been bad before but now it feels hopeless. i am and diagnosed with bp ii, gad and adhd c. it is been a year since i have been out of the hospital and i feel like nothing has changed. i am going to try to chronicle the events of the past year because i think the events are still relevant. i really do not know what i am looking for by posting this but at this point i have nothing left to lose. about two years ago, i decided to move back to la from the desert town i have been stuck in due to financial issues for years. my mother, my two younger sisters and myself could not continue to stay where we were. so my parents reconciled enough to cohabit. they thought it was best for my youngest sister to be in a stable two parent household. this was complete horseshit and nothing was really different besides the fact we were out of the ghettos of south la. i really had no choice in the matter. i am an actor by trade and i thought that this could be my big chance to get back into that world. i took my shitty truck and started looking for places to stay. i was able to move in with my aunt on the agreement it was to be temporary. i was able to get a job working for a friend of hers who owns a doctor is office for mmj in los angeles. that job lasted all of a few days because of i actually had no clue why they fired me, it was under the table so i could not exactly file an unlawful termination suit. i could not get a straight answer out of him so eventually i stopped caring. i had to leave my aunt is house because there was no room when her friend came back from italy. on the advice of her boyfriend, i bought a cheap honda for , it ended putting me thousands of dollars in debt to her to get it repaired. i know absolutely nothing about cars at this point and i thought that i could trust the advice of him due to him being a certified mechanic. i ended up moving in with a friend and his family while bouncing around from job to job, that lasted all of months until i could not stand it any more. he was a pill junkie and constantly lied, put me down in front of others and completely disrespectful of my presence. i know he was sharing a room with me but it was so disgusting there. that whole apartment was constantly dirty, and i do not mean messy. there was old food left out, dishes that did not get washed for weeks on end, trash that piled up and they had cats. lot of cats. i did as much as i could but apathy eventually set in and i just adjusted. it came to a head when i could not deal with his self loathing anymore, i left and have not talked to him since. i moved back in with my parents and found a job at a temp agency, i felt so good that in addition to working at least hours a week, i also went back to school and took units, hypo mania had officially been triggered! everything was fine for a while, but then i started to feel this emptiness, i was only sleeping hours a night if at all. i let both my parents know but they did not know what to do. i talked to the psychologist at the college but she only marveled at the fact i had not snapped yet. i did not have any sort of healthcare, so i could literally only smoke weed and hope that it at least evened me out. i could not even be treated in the county facility until i demonstrated intent of harm. my birthday came around and i told my sister and friends that i did not want a party, but they threw me one anyway. i blew up and spent the entire day in my room crying. eventually my grades started to slip because of my lack of studying and i started to fall through on my work, i would except jobs and then back out at the last second leaving my employer to find someone else. april , while working at a hotel, i tripped and damaged my neck, left shoulder and right knee. work comp barely covered any sort of medical care and my average pay over the year was so low that unemployment did not even get me through a week. as the end of the semester came and the work season started tapering down, i just lost my shit. maybe it was because my sister and her bf had moved into the house and we had adults unemployed, a kid showing signs of bipolar and dogs in a bedroom house but who knows. i eventually had myself checked in on a to the hospital, while i was there, i was drugged on a gurney in a hallway for almost days waiting for a slot at the mental hospital to open up. it finally did and i spent the next day wandering around a by cube with other check ins. they offered to put me under observation in their facility for a period of two weeks where i would receive counseling and undergo psychiatric review. i figured two weeks would be easy, but i did not realize how bad it would be. i tried to keep myself calm but i could not. i was bouncing off the fucking walls. i could not have caffeine or sugar and the food was just awful. it destroyed my stomach, i am not a super strict eater but my diet was clean. the second or third day there, the only person anywhere close to my age showed up. a woman who checked herself in after being stung while sleeping in some bushes after getting kicked out high as fuck on heroin. she was attracted to me and i was attracted to the fact that she was attracted to me. i finally saw the psych who proceeded to tell me that my symptoms were not because of my previous diagnoses but of me doing too much lsd! he told me i should buy his book that proves he has cured tons of people of this disease caused by residual lsd in the spinal cord. i told him that was bull because lsd is water soluble and gets out of your system within a week. he would not listen to a word i said and perscribed me novane. i was of course forced to take it. i hated it because it made me cloudy. a week into my stay, the girl said she was leaving because they could not accommodate her veganism. a few hours later, i made the choice to leave to follow her, i ca not say anything else but i was thinking with my dick. i met up with her the next day and shit really hit the fan, i bought her new clothes and new glasses and was so convinced she was the one. she has kids from different dads and she lived with her parents. she did not want to go face her stepdad so she stayed with me in my tiny ass room in my tiny ass loft bed. all she was sleep, when she was not sleeping, she would insult me and just be a bitch in general. she convinced me that she needed to get her fix and i agreed because she promised me sex and i had not had any physical contact for a long, long while before that. eventually she went to stay with her brother for a few days and i did not hear from her at all, i finally talked to her and went over there with the intent of spending the night. but she decided that she need her fix, even after that, the insults and just general bullshit, i walked away. she blew up my phone telling me this is how i proved i really wanted her, i told her i was done and put all her stuff in a bag. she finally got it weeks later. the rest of that summer was waiting for treatment, i tried to self medicate with an old seroquel prescription but that just made me psychotic and unorderly. i said a lot of nasty things, i still feel guilty about it. there was just way too much stress in my house at the time. when i did get to see a doctor, she took absolutely nothing i said seriously, i could not have another doctor because that would mean another or so months without treatment. she put me on lamictal and welbutrin. because of the clinic is refusal to even consider prescribing heavy medication. my adhd was left untreated, my symptoms got worse because i no longer had the level of cognitive function i used to to keep the impulse controls in check. going back to school was out and to top it off, my car broke down and i ended up selling it for parts, the money at least got me through the to the winter. i took as many jobs as i could but i was limited by transport and mobility. i spent the summer trying to get back on my feet only to be pushed back down again, my knee was not healing and they had yet to identify the problem, my dad is decision to get a new car for himself put me back in financial straits, it was a gas guzzler and he got screwed on the lease price. my sister and her boyfriend moved out because he was able to afford his section controlled rent again and my mother could no longer stand my dad and took my youngest sister with her and left me and my dad alone with two dogs and late bills. cont in comments...",depression

-78.23334,-3.7709556,"dialysis and disease traumatized me, and now i just wait for the end. i was born with a genetic kidney disorder, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. about seven years ago i received a kidney from a living donor. i am glad i did, not so much because i am still alive but because it stopped the hell i was in with dialysis. at first i was on hemodialysis. every other day i sat in a chair in a room with or so people much older than me and had my blood pumped out of me, cleaned, and pumped back in. the air stank like death, i experienced painful cramping, felt trapped in that damn chair, and worst of all felt like i was losing vital life energy every day. like my kidney failure was killing me quickly and the dialysis was just barely slowing that process. a few times i just could not take it anymore, freaked out and demanded to be taken off the machine. after about five months of that i decided i could not do it anymore, and convinced the doctors to switch me over to peritoneal dialysis that i could do myself at home. after more surgery to install the required tubes i started cleaning my own fluids, every day, three times a day, trapped in my room. it was not any better. i was not stuck surrounded by other walking corpses, but that was the only part that was even moderately more tolerable. a couple of times i did venture out of my room to try to reconnect with friends, but it did not go well. i could tell that they were all shocked and uncomfortable around me. i looked like death, with gray skin and sunken eyes, and they told me so. i stopped going out, and depression hit me hard. for three more months i went through this. i was living with my parents and it put an incredible strain on our relationship that still is not healed. every day, all day, i wanted to just stop and let my body do what it clearly wanted to do, which was to die. once i got my new kidney i felt much better, almost instantly. and for a while i grabbed life by the horns and tried to make the most of my newfound energy. but my friends all treated me differently. i knew that every time they saw me they only saw that walking dead man. most treated me like some fragile object, some stopped spending time with me completely, and all of them asked about my kidneys whenever they saw me. i just wanted to put it behind me and be seen as the old me again, but clearly they only saw my disease. saw me as a disease. eventually i broke ties with all of them. now i have no friends. fatigue hits me hard all the time and i am not sure if it is because of the pkd or the depression. and worst of all i know that eventually my donor kidney is going to stop working and i am going to have to go through that hell all over again. but this time it will be different. i am not going on dialysis again. not even for one day. i would rather just retire to my bed and fade away. maybe once it is time a donor will be immediately available or science will be able to make me a new kidney with stem cells or something and i wo not have to go on dialysis again but i doubt it. not with my luck. so i am fairly certain my time left on this earth is limited to how long this kidney keeps on ticking along. i do not know how long that will be, but i assume it is not much more than ten years or so. not nearly enough time to do any of the things i want to do with my life. so i just wait. work and wait. i do not want to go to therapy. what can they do about it? give me some sketchy antidepressant drug that forces a false smile on my face, so that the rest of society can feel more comfortable around me? eff that. i have every reason to be depressed and i would rather spend the rest of my time here being honest and genuine. i do not want to make new friends or fall in love with someone because i feel that this hooded specter over my shoulder will just infect their optimism and bring them down to my level. that is not me having a pity party, it is happened already. it will happen again. no matter how happy and positive they are, my darkness is stronger. i do not seek death. i know it will come to me in its own time. but i have no joy for life anymore. and so i wait.",depression

well i will say it like this. a group of friends with a reputation that when we showed up there was gonna be a party, there was gonna be some funny stuff going on and our biggest rep...there was gonna be some fighting. i started smoking green when i was and drinking around the same age. i loved every bit of the party life. maybe it was the false feeling of not being alone. i met the woman of my dreams in highschool but i was broken. there are some things in my life i cant share right now but through all the good times i have seen and done things that im not proud of. i was not faithful, not a good boyfriend or father. when my oldest was born i dont remember it. i dont remember her first birthday...heck i dont remember much of the first years of her life. when i was a best friend was killed in a drinking accident. the realist dude i ever knew was gone. at a party i should have been at so i believed he decided to leave and it would be his last. i had an accident a few months prior driving drunk and decided to stop partying. that all ended when my best friend was killed. i vowed never again will i miss a party. each day may be the last time i see someone i cared about and if i was there i would have stopped him. my oldest daughter never got to meet my friend and that hurt so freaking bad. years of party is and living the high life all caught up to me one summer afternoon. i sat on the front porch and it was like i was smacked by a truck. i watched my daughter running in the front yard and it hit me so hard my chest physically hurt. i didnt remember her first birthday, her first steps, her first words or much else for that matter. as i watched her playing in the front yard begging for my attention i broke down in tears. i was not a man and damn sure wasnt a father. almost to late i was tried of being a failure and decided that day that i would no longer be the looser i believed i was. when i set my mind to something that was that and i would accomplish it. so i did for a while. my past and my feelings of wanting to be needed kept catching up to me. then my second baby girl came into my world. i remember her first steps, her first words and the way she smiled when i blew on her belly. i was a father again but this time i would not fail. a few years later my rd baby girls came along and life want to bad. i may not have been a great husband but i was trying. but i knew i could be a great father. but history repeats its self and even when i kept it at bay i still got the blame. my mom once told me that i can never love someone until i forgive myself and learn to love myself. unfortunately loving myself was never easy. as life went on and i felt unloved for many years by my wife. the world had consumed us and when i looked at my wife i saw a stranger. like an addict i made excuses for my actions. she doesnt love me then i will find another girl to love me for the night. one night i was at the bar and i seen a woman sitting at a booth with a guy hitting on her. so i did what i do and out played him. as i took this girl to a place were my friends and i hung out we talked. but then i seen something from my teenage years. something my friends and i stole years ago, painted and had everyone who came to our party is sign. the signatures i seen first was my wife is, mine and my friend that i lost. my friend had died alone, no girlfriend no nothing. one night we had been drinking and talking real talk. he told me.. man you dont know how lucky you are. you have a girlfriend and a baby on the way. dont screw that up, please bro. i would give anything to be in your place right now . as i looked at his signature a tear rolled down my cheek. at that moment i was brought back to that place. i told her i was married and had kids and couldnt do this. she figured i was married and didnt care but understood. i had stood up to that demon iniside me and smaked him back to the depths. from a better place my friend reminded me that life could be worse, life could end at any moment and is this how i wanted to be remembered? damn bro i miss you every day! for a couple years after that life was ok. i wasnt happy but i was trying to be content. i have never lost faith and for a while in life i actually helped people. i helped people who the rest of the world wrote them off. i guess cause i knew what it was like to have the rest of the world judge you but know nothing about a person. but at some point my life took a turn for the worse. i dont know where, how or why but it did. the guy who was the life of the party, never scared to say anything and scared of no man developed anxiety. i started having attacks and at one point i snapped on someone. as i grabbed him by the neck i was going to kill him. not beat him up, not hurt him but i was going to end his life. alot of people say this very thing but have no idea when its real. i have had guns pulled on me, i have been stabbed, jumped and hit with bats, pipes etc. im no stranger to violence or fights and have wanted to destroy people before but never the real actual feeling of wanting to take a life. after calming down i realized..i need help. i have been court ordered therapy and anger management before and bluffed my way through it. but this was real and i knew i had to fix this. lots of therapy and a guinea pig for tons of meds it never got better. there were bad days and not so bad but for a long long time no more good days. soon i became scared to go out with friends or hell go to the store. my marrige is a show and im scared to be a father doing the minimum for the fear of making a mistake and dissapointing the people i love. i pushed everyone away. my friends, my kids, parents, if there is a chance that i can get close i push. alot has happened in my life and some how some way it has gotten the best of me. i want to go back to church but im scared. i want to play with my children but im scared. i see a friend getting gas and i avoid them. i have secluded myself to work and home. i smile for everyone so they wont ask questions. so as i sat on a milk crate with the muzzle pointed at my head praying for the strength to squeeze the trigger i could feel the cold stainless steel muzzle thread protector on my barrel shoving into the side of my head. i could smell the pro oil i had used the last time i stripped and cleaned it. i could hear the quiet sound of the slide gently pushing back but not enough to take it out of battery. it felt like my senses were enhanced and this may finally be the moment were i have the courage to send my death to the express line. then i thought of something that took my courage away. what if one of my baby is finds me? what do the kids at school say to them..your daddy killed himself like a coward. is this how i will leave my children confused, wondering why, wondering if it was something they did. god help me. i dont know what to do. where did it all go wrong. when did i give up and for god snakes why. i look in the mirror and hate the man looking back. i have changed every part of who i am to try to be the person my wife wanted, to be the person i thought maybe i should be. now the real me is lost and i cant find him anywhere. i have nobody to talk to. in the end everyone i care about goes away, friends become people i once knew and im so scared to die alone. i guess i needed to get this out. its such a small part of my story but now at least its a part of my story that is off my chest.",depression

he shrieks through the earpiece. we will make a million dollars, just like pewdiepie, and both of us can even have fancy cars, and all the videogames we want!! i let him have his fun. even though i know that all of that stuff most likely would never happen if we moved in together, i do not see the harm in humoring the idea. for the next year and a half, i attend a local community college. i do poorly. i lose all motivation to be in school, and i start to daydream about leaving my shitty hometown and shitty college behind for a truly independent life, free of institutions and bosses and managers, etc. i know it is foolish, but my depression guides me to these outlandish and desperate thoughts. i drop out of school. my parents are devastated. my mother tells me that she feels that she has failed to raise me properly, and that i am not the son she wanted to have . now is the time. i think to myself. i have burnt the bridges, and now it is time to start my new life from scratch. this is what all of my complacency and self destructive tendencies have been building towards. i can be like eminem in that one song about when he hit rock bottom and then he became a famous rapper out of sheer determination. those thoughts lasted for maybe a day. turns out, it does not feel good to lose the support of your parents. in fact, it feels pretty fucking horrible. i had not just lost their support financially, but also emotionally as well. they were too disappointed in me to comfort me or tell me that everything was going to be alright. the time for sentiment and gentle care was over. for the next few weeks, arguments and fights erupted almost every night in the house. emotions were at a boiling point, and it was only a matter of time before my parents finally kicked me out for good. during this time, i spoke with boogie regularly, detailing what was going on, and stressing the importance of us moving out together soon. boogie happily encouraged this line of thinking. he was very lonely and desperate for a chance to live with someone else. plus, it would ease his financial troubles if i split the rent cost with him. honestly, i did not think boogie was the best candidate for a roommate. he was mentally handicapped, socially awkward, disorganized, and far too idealistic. i needed somebody to help pay the rent though, and boogie was my only option. i had nowhere else to turn. until... fast forward to the present an old friend of mine from high school gives me a call. it is joseph. he is been saving up money for awhile at his current job, and attending classes at the local community college. he tells me that he is been looking for someone to move out with, and i told him that i am in the same boat. he tells me about prior roommates who bailed on him or ended up screwing him over financially in some form or another. he wishes that he could find somebody responsible. someone who does not do drugs. someone who can hold a job. someone who could respect his space. me. me. i wanted this. joseph is the only guy i remember from high school in my group of friends who had his head on straight. he did not do drugs, he was raised by two good parents i have met them before, they are amazing , he is organized, he showers regularly, he shows up to work on time, and he plans for his future. in other words, he is the exact opposite of boogie. for the last two weeks, me and joseph have been looking around for apartments in town. i told him to keep an eye out for bedroom places, in case boogie wanted to join us joseph knows boogie from school too . joseph agreed, but he seemed a to get a little tense whenever i brought up boogie in our conversations. one day, joseph found it. the perfect place. we took the house tour, met the landlord who was very kind , and scoped out the details. everything was going great...until i realized something was wrong. ...where is the third bedroom? i asked. the landlord and joseph looked at me with a nervous apprehension in their eyes. catjack...we need to to talk. joseph said to me. we went outside. boogie ca not live with us. he plainly stated. why??? for one, this is a two bedroom flat. we should try to find a bedroom then, we ca not just second joseph interjected. boogie smokes weed, dude. he is a more of a liability to us than a contributing member of the household. smoking weed does not make him a bad person, and he does not even do it that often! let me ask you this, catjack. how is boogie going to make it to work? well...he does not have a car. yes? and he does not have a driver is license. mmhmm. and he does not have a bike. yep. so...i guess...he would...want us to drive him. uh huh. fuck. fuck is right. joseph...i know boogie does not have it all together, but i promised him that we would move out as a team! he is been waiting years for someone to come along and help pay a portion of his rent so that he can finally stop living paycheck to paycheck! i would be helping him helping him what? save money? the money that he spends on videogames and junk food whenever he gets the chance? he does not budget at all, dude. he lives paycheck to paycheck because he does not have discipline, and he does not think ahead. fuck, fuck, yes, i know, i know....i just...i promised. silence falls between us. i ca not believe this. i told boogie i would help him. he needs me, or else he is never going to escape the crappy little apartment he lives in. boogie will never get out of that fucking pit on his own. if i do not help him...no one will. his mom is a junkie. his dad is in jail. and i am the only friend he is got. fuck. i have no idea what to do. should i try to convince joseph to search for a bedroom apartment and insist that boogie comes to live with us? should i stay with joseph in the bedroom apartment and leave boogie to fend for himself on a minimum wage job and risk losing him as a friend? or should i leave joseph behind, and honor my promise to boogie?",depression

but honestly. think about it. hell, your life must be pretty harsh right now, things ar not going to well. but i believe you have at least one thing. write it down. now, whenever you hear this voice, grab that notebook. and read that one thing in that list. next time, you hear that voice again. go back to that notebook and read that one thing. now, you may or may not go back to your notebook times in one day i did... , but one of those times i can bet that you might have thought of another thing that makes you happy. write that down under the first thing. shit, now you got two things to read, not too shabby now eh? eventually, this list will get bigger and bigger, and you must always refer back to this list when you hear that voice. pretty simple stuff. now, this is where it might get weird. right above that first item in the list i want you to write in big, bold, capital letters... i love you, unconditionally. and when you write that down say it to yourself. it is going to be fucking weird. but i believe that everyone has another voice in their head. the one that brings you up, recalls past memories of just happiness and joyous time in your life. maybe you never had the best parents or the best friends, but hey... you got this voice. and it loves you, no matter what. now... that is the voice you want to listen too. eventually, this voice will get louder and louder. and that other voice from before? it is going to start to quiet down. trust me. if you want, start to add things that you love about yourself. anything you love about yourself. come on there has to be something... let that voice hear it. everyone, that is it. it is nice to have that notebook handy. i keep it in my car, and i bring it with me on my lunch breaks. if you are a student, shit you have plenty of notebooks to use. bring it to class. as a few days weeks go by of doing this. start a new section in that notebook. add some goals you have in mind, anything that you believe will make your life better. no matter how far fetched those goals may be, write em down. guys... this is my way of loving yourself. you can have all that you want in your life, great job, a home, friends... but if you do not love yourself, none of these things matter. so try it, see if it works for you. just thought i would share my way of getting out of this shitty fucking illness. it is terrible. but there is always a way out. seek help, talk to friends if you can, but always remember that the one person that will never let you down, will always have your back, will be with you with every decision, high point, or low point in your life, is you. so love you.",depression

-77.147224,-4.708269,"dumped while studying abroad alone and depressed so, over a month before going abroad i met a guy in a town i was doing pre departure training, and we hit it off really well. we started spending a lot of time together, and by the time i was ready to leave, we were basically spending every day together. i even introduced him to my mother before leaving for my hometown, and after returning home for a couple days before leaving for abroad , we spoke constantly. before i left, we planned that we would do an ldr for months, then i would try to move to his town within a couple months of coming back in country. fast forward weeks abroad i have been sick constantly and we have already had a small fight. we have a big fight and i tell him that i am getting the vibe that he needs space. he says i do not get to make that decision, i tell him we need some days to think about things, we do not talk for a week. we almost break up when we speak again days later, but we manage to stay together. later that weekend, i try to talk to him about our future. this has been both a bonding matter and a point of contention, because we had already started planning a future together when i lived in his town and we were dating, but it got more difficult as things became clear about our short term realities. after some discussion, he reluctantly agrees to talk about the logistic possibilities with me. the conversation gets more tense as i explain to him that i am realizing it may be difficult for me to move close to him, and offer several other solutions flying down every weekend, moving to a town that is several hours away, living in his town but working a couple hours away . he tells me that he wants to see me every day, but when i present the solution of us living together, he says it is too soon. he ultimately says he has to think, but when he calls me back later, he says that he thinks that it is a bad idea. if i live in his town, it is hard for me to find a job, and i will be miserable. if i live in the next town over or a few hours away , he ca not see me every day, and he will be miserable. either way, he does not see a way that both of us will be happy. he seems to be determined that there is no solution, and he asks me what i think. i tell him that if only he would compromise a little, we could try to find something. but no, he does not. and so we end things. he tells me that he loves me, but keeps trying to end the conversation by saying goodbye, and says he does not think we should talk more. needless to say, that night, i cried myself to sleep. he has not called, texted, messaged, anything, ever since. now, i am abroad, in another continent, with a program that will continue for another months. my friends back home give me the occasional pat on the back, followed by a light scolding you will be alright, but you should really get over him he was obviously a jerk . i appreciate their support, but it really is not enough. my parents are not supportive of me, in general, and i do not have access to a therapist here. i have been here for about a month now it is almost a week after my ex dumped me , but i have not been able to make many friends because i am very introverted and the other students i came with are very clique ish and make plans without me. for background i am in my mid s, a woman, and in africa. i do not know how one gets over something like this. i suppose this is the only outlet i can think of. the problem is that as i feel more pain, it is more difficult for me to socialize or reach out to people, and thus i turn more and more to myself, books, movies, or social media, which feel familiar. social media is not good, because it shows me how my friends are moving on with their lives while i feel i am stuck rationally, i know this is not true, but it is the feeling . tldr i got dumped by my bf while a month into study abroad after he had promised and planned a whole future with me including marriage, kids, etc . totally broken hearted and alone, in another country and continent, where i only kind of speak the language. does anyone have any advice? i am not a big fan of exercise, and it is very hot here, so that is a tough thing to do. besides exercise and reaching out, anyone have any suggestions?",depression

9.635162,20.163857,"do not feel guilty about being depressed for me it was a reaction to the insecurity of society. there is nothing wrong with any of us. not a thing. we are all human beings, and we are all imperfect. for years i made the mistake of thinking that productive, or so called isuccessful people, are actually winners. it is this western society we live in it wants to use and abuse you for its own ends, so from the moment you are born it stresses the importance of work to you. of productivity. of looking respectable. of chasing the dream. it wants you to buy this, behave like that, say this and criticize that. it does this because it wants things that you have it wants your labour, your money, and most importantly it wants your personality. are we really winners if we sell ourselves to it? no. we should pursue individual satisfaction. it wants to take your personality and mould it into whatever it wants. it does not care if you love, for example, music. it does not care how sincerely you love the act of playing creating, it only cares about how much it can make from you. a label wo not sign you unless you make music that will sell. it is frowned upon to be in a band and to write songs and not aim to amake it . open your eyes. this applies to everything around you. society freaks out when you do something truly for yourself. it attacks you why make music if not to sell it? why write a book if not to sell it? why climb a mountain if not to post a photo online? why spend a few hours alone in the forest, examining different types of flowers trees animals? that is weird. right? that is what we have grown up being told. that if you are not going to the gym to keep fit, going out drinking to socialize, going to work for satisfaction, getting married to have kids, that you are weird? that there s something wrong with you? but why should we have to believe that? so many people are so brainwashed and insecure. social skills are such an effective mask for insecurity. i know so many people who have been in loads of relationships over the years, and have proven that they have no problem finding a new one when one ends, and yet these are horrible, abusive, insecure, insulting, cruel people. but we are not like that. people who suffer from depression have so much more empathy than people who have spent their whole lives using everyone around them to feel good about themselves. these people are afraid to stand out. they all have to pretend to be normal every day, and how boring do their lives look? fuck that. do what you want. in my opinion there is no purpose destiny fate. i do not feel compelled to do anything, but yet i like to play guitar and record songs in my bedroom. it s not a passion i don t have one. yet i can still get up in the morning and be excited for the day, because i live how i like. sure, i don t feel destined to do anything but i still like guitar. i still like steak, so i ll have a steak for dinner. i still like films so i ll go to the cinema. you see, your dreams may be hurting you. i used to dream of being a world famous musician, and of being a social master. but i realized one day that what i really wanted here was people s the acceptance, which was never going to happen the way i visualized. reality is so complex, there s no way that it will ever conform to something that you visualized in your head. the way i see it, you have no control over the world outside of you. everything happens regardless of what you do. you can influence the world, yes, but you can t control it. likewise, you can t control the world inside of you either. you can t choose to not think a thought, or to unthink one once it has been thought. you can t unfeel an emotion, you can t unlike something. you can suppress and ignore everything yes, but once again you can t control it. but you can control your reactions to all this. someone insults you, you don t have to accept it. sure, the insult occurred, and you heard it and understood it, but it doesn t have to affect you because you had no control over that person anyway. find happiness in your reactions. see the world in front of you and listen to your internal emotions thoughts and react how you want. pursue your dreams in the real world, don t let your perfect visions burn you out because they re never going to happen the way you envision. i used to feel depressed and weird about not giving a damn about ninety nine percent of what i see around me. but i do not feel weird about it anymore. i realize that society is a deeply insecure thing populated by deeply insecure people who do not want you to have a rich, individual experience. they want to drag you down to their level, where they have to make fun of anyone different, talk about people behind their backs just to have something to talk about, get drunk four nights a week just so they can feel normal. all we want is to be free of depression. for me, this viewpoint has been the beginning of a pathway out. i know that many of you may be a lot more depressed than me, and i understand if this wo not work. this might only be my understanding of how to help myself. but look, in brief society is afraid of people who want to have an individual experience. a lot of depressed people are disillusioned with society, but feel bad for being like this. well, do not feel bad. an individual experience is worth so much more than a mediocre, pre defined one. want to stay in bed for a day? do if you want to. want to go to the pub? do if you want to. want to go in search of a flower in the forest? do if you want to. but only if you want to. and remember that when someone makes fun of you or mocks you for doing what you wanted to do, that s just them acting out of insecurity. have your beautiful personal experiences and don t worry about the insecure society and its insecure people. find your happiness in what you can control and let the moment happen.",depression

as i am trying to be extremely honest and do not want to insight jealousy or resentment based on my situation. i thank you in advance. i am miserable and i really should not be, i do not have a right to be. i have a beautiful wife and year old daughter and anotger child on the way. i own a house fully paid off in the most desired livable places in the world making me worth millions in assets alone. have also beautiful beach front holiday home i can retreat to whenever i want...so basically i am a man who has everything he needs and wants, yet i feel i am constantly suffering in my own head. i have wealthy parents hence my wealth so nothing i own i have personally earnt. maybe this is why? however i also know enough about depression that there is not necessarily a single reason to feel this way...it is a mental illness. my problems centre around my working life. do i need to work? well regardless of my assets i still need to make an income to feed and support my own family...mummy and daddy are not going to help with that. and here lies the problem with me. i would say i am skilled. since leaving high school i have done a number of qualifications. telecommunications, information technology network architect and i am just now finishing my apprenticeship as an electrician where i am from, we are the best trained in the world . however, although i have skills and my peers in these industries all earn upwards of k annually i am yet to have employment that pays higher than minimum wage in my entire working life. i have done so much skilled work for somebody else and have no financial gains to show for it. i find my working life has been simply training for years without any gains. i have had jobs in the past years, of which i have been asked to leave. they all tell me the exact samething... oh, sorry bud the company ai not doing to well and you do not seem to want to be here, we are gonna have to let you go . this seems to happen on the month mark almost like clockwork. i find when i undertake any sort of apprentiship i go through minimum employers before completion. however with my electrical apprenticeship this will be my rd. it is not like i dont put in the effort. most days i have been working are typically hours. night shifts on occasion requiring me to be back at work within hours of my shift ending. i have done hour shifts multiple times and this monday i am going to be doing a hour day. so when a boss tells me some crap like we do not think you are putting in enough effort or you dont seem like you want to be here the anger is almost too much to bear. based on the hours i had worled for some of those businesses, i had been there longer than the employers. i have come to the conclusion that hard work gets you absolutely fucking nothing. so do not be a fool if you think you gain any sort of browny points for pushing these ridiculous hours like i was. currently i have been doing my own work on the side so i can make more than minimum wage. i am workin hours a day days a week just to get by. in my day job i only get paid for but on weekends those hours almost net me my entire weekly wage eith one problem...i am burnt out. suddenly death seems really appealing...i would like think im not suicidal but it just seems so peaceful. it obviously is not an option because i love my daughter and wife so much that i wpuld suffer an eternity for them. however all this work is now making me resent them a little bit for taking my attention for the little timr i am not working. i simply come home and my daughter wants me to play with her and my wife wants me to talk. i really cant do either. i come home and stare into space consumed by anxiety about going back to work in a few hours. i cant stand sleeping as i just know that means i lose all that time. not only that but i feel lile absolute shit when i wake up. ca not stomach food in the mornings i throw up so my breakfast consists of coffee and about or cigarettes. then after my extremely unhealthy wake up ritual i start my day of hard physical labour, risking electrocution and other worksite hazards whilst getting screamed at for minimum hours all for minimum wage. then i go home and let my anxiety consume me for another night. my wife and i went out the other night to see the aladdin stage show. i use to love going to the theatre with her but this was torture. it was the first time i had been out in public other than for work in about months. i could not stand it. all these happy people around me taking selfies and yapping. i felt like screaming at everyone. i was so anxious an full of what i can omly describe as pure rage. my wife said she could hear me grinding my teeth and my face was extremely red. aparently veins were shoong on my neck. i fucking hated it. needless to say i have not left the house for anything other than work since. i am ignoring people including my own family now and slipping pretty badly. i look to the future and all i see is work. it all just seems so exhausting. i look to the past and all i see is regret and wasted time. also knowing that my pessimistic views will probably kill me long before i get the chance to retire let alone cigarettes. cigarettes actually seem to be the only thing i focus on to get through the days. it is my little break for minutes while i quickly suck it down. they actually do nothing for me but i have associated them with relaxing or stopping work so they are my go to excuse. i am also smoking pot just so i can turn off the anxiety switch before i go to bed. i am in the worst cycle. however i do not drink do at least i am not heading down the path of alcoholism. in the end my life is spiralling out of control or at least in my own head. i ca not stand the general public, i am finding myself ignoring my friends and family and doing everthing in my power with the little energy i have to avoid all kinds of interaction with human beings just so i can be consumed by anxiety alone. this is not healthy and i am trying to find a a way out that doesnt involve ending it. but death is looking more peaceful everyday.",depression

out who i am. i really don t want my people to know about this. but i ve come to a point where i don t know what else to do but ask for help on a social media in an anonymous way. i m gonna try to give the more details i can without leaving too much doubt about who could be hidden behind those words, so, i apologize if some of the things i ll be telling would sound wrong or would need more explanations. i m fine with people writing me private messages if you feel like you can help, in any way possible. it s something i ve been meaning to do for a long time now, and, damn, there are so many things to tell that i don t really know where to begin. let s try to start from the beginning. i m somewhere between and and i m the second oldest of my siblings. i m suffering from crippling depression and, lately, it s been getting worst and worst. i even had to stop working, a job i hated by the way, because my depression was so hard to handle that i had multiple panic attacks at work. i knew it was high time to do something about it, so i finished my contract with them, and i just decided to get a little time for myself. i m financially stable though, so it s no big deal for my partner or myself, me not working. i started therapy a few months ago, i have a session every week, and even though it s helping , it s definitely not enough. i don t feel any improvement in my mental health, i d even say that my suicidal tendencies have never been more tempting than ever. why though? let s be as short as possible, but clear about it. my mother had a terrible childhood, and adulthood wasn t that much a pleasure too. it lead her to a deep depression she s suffering from even on this day, making her insensible to every form of sadness or desperation, even toward her children. she dated my father while very young and had me quickly afterward. but from the very beginning of their relationship, she wasn t in love with him. she s never been, really. anyway, they still had more children together, as my mother is a pure anti abortion woman, and my dad s just an idiot. the more children they had, the poorer we became, the lonelier we became, too. my old man and i never got along so well. to be honest, i never felt like he loved me or wanted me in his life whatsoever. still, he seemed to get along fine with the rest of my sibling, except for one, whom he used to beat and mentally abuse through his whole childhood. the violence was so intense, and he had no shame in hurting him while mom wasn t watching that i got to see it with my own eyes, several times. i was too young to realize what was happening, but i just knew that it wasn t right. as we got older, the lonely feeling became more and more physical, you know. like we could feel how our parents didn t have time for us, especially my mom. she used to work a lot while my dad was doing sports or listening to music on his own, not giving a damn about us. eventually, they broke up and that s where the real shit started. she left home as i was a teenager, found another man, and was on her quest for a new home of hers. we had to stay with our incapable, violent and inconsiderate dad, in the same apartment that she used to live in too. at first, it was hard, because i felt like i could see her in every corner of the apartment even though she wasn t there anymore. but as she kept on not giving us signs of life or advancement in her search for a new home, the feeling just faded away. when someone, even, nay, mostly your mother doesn t call you or send you texts for several days, sometimes even weeks, it s hard to keep attached as you were at first. that s what it felt like for me, anyways. i never blamed her for geoing on a quest for a new home, i just feel so bad she left us behind too. but mom not spending time with me or my siblings isn t the problem in this period, even though it became, later, my old man was. he couldn t bear my mom leaving him, so he started drinking, having weird frequentations, acting more violent, even toward the youngest of us. but mostly toward me. he said i was the reason mom left, because i was a weirdo let s just say that i ve always been the quiet, reserved, timid one. i enjoyed reading, listening to music on my own too, drawing, and other activities where i can be alone and don t feel like bothering anyone, especially my old man who, like i said, wasn t really found of me and that he should have killed himself on the day i was born. his attitude got worse on every passing day, the anger always growing in his heart and mind. and, as an evidence, after several mental abuse, physical abuse like pushing me, forbidding me to eat the food he prepared, leaving me starving in my room alone, him spreading rumors about how a whore i was in our neighborhood, he hit me. so bad i thought he could ve killed me. eventually, someone stopped him, and i spend the rest of the week calling my mom, who wasn t responding, hiding in my bedroom, too scared to get out. when mom finally picked up, i got to spend some days with her. i felt safer, and i almost completely forgot how she abandoned us all this time. she told me about this colleague of hers who could take care of me so i could get some time away from home. i accepted. as i felt like things were finally turning good for me, the guy ended up not being who i thought he was. at all. so i preferred going back to my messy and traumatizing family than staying in this place. i don t want to get into too much details about that but let s say, i ve been sexually abused as a child, as a teenager, and been raped several times as grown up. when we finally got to leave my old man s home to live with mom, things didn t get any better. she already was way too used to have her freedom and her own life without us that our mental state and our traumas just didn t matter to her. i don t really know if it really didn t matter or if she just didn t see it at all, but still, it was really hard. we were all drowning, and still are, yet she still doesn t do anything to change that and to help us. finally, my old man ended up moving away to another city, far, far from us, and gives really rare news to my siblings, leaving them in this even more painful, lonely feeling. i don t have any connection with him anymore, and don t want to have anyways. all this happened as i was a teenager, even the moving to my mom s and the colleague taking care of me. my old man left before i hit . as i said earlier, i m the second oldest, just imagine how it felt, for the youngest, to have a dad moving away, not caring for his children, and a mother too focused on living her own life. today, everyone is left with a scar that won t heal, wounds that will never recover. half of my siblings have depression, or symptoms really close to this mental disease, including me, and none of our parents care. i ve been taking care of them, doing my mother s job, listening to their problems, visiting them as much as i can, i even take one of my brother sister to a therapist. but i feel like it s not enough. i feel like it s going nowhere, because the more i try, having to deal with my own depression, the deeper they fall. cause mom barely cares. she s never been the loving and caring mother, and she told us she ll never be. it s something she s incapable of doing. lately she s been trying to get some interest in our mental states though, cause we confronted her and tried to make her realize how important it is that she helps us too get over it, recover from our traumatic childhood. we yelled at her, we cried, she told us horrible things i can t share here cause it s too much for me to bear. but i know deep down that she s already at her best. she just can t do more. she doesn t want to. this made me realize something. one thing. and that s where i need you guys. cause i feel like i ve already made my decision, but still, i need to find hope again, i need to know if there are any other solution than that. it s been clear here that the problem in my family is that no one seems to comprehend one another, that every advice, every helping hand, every comforting word or demonstration of love is just something we ll enjoy from the time being, but will automatically forget the day after, cause we re just too much used to being alone and sad, without anyone really caring about it. we re not the type of family that says i love you easily, there is no communication, no cohesion, we re a broken family, full of individuals living their own sadness and depression on our side, too afraid to annoy one another by clearly stating i m not ok, please help me . and i feel like dying is the only way my family would find that bound, that true and powerful bound we ve all been waiting for. i always thought that, in every situation or almost every, when someone dies, people gather together, and links start to create or recreate between people. what if my death is the key for everyone to understand how important it is to recreate, or maybe just create this bound my family never had? that s why i ve been doing bad shit lately, to slowly kill myself. cause i am so fudging tired of trying and failing. as i said, i m seeing a therapist, and of course, i m taking meds. i ve been taking too many, every day, sometimes even drinking while completely stoned by the meds, i smoke a lot and i, shamefully, self harm. discreet enough so people don t freak out about it. but painful enough for it to hurt my body. i just don t want to kill myself, i m just too scared to do it. so i found ways, though poisoning, until, eventually, i fall into a coma and never wake up. i feel like it s the only solution ever to this problem that s been tearing us apart for so many years. sorry for the very long post but i need help. i really do. tldr crippling depression due to traumatizing childhood, siblings having same mental health problems, dad left early, mom doesn t take care of her children. no bound in family. feels like dying is the only way to make it better.",depression

-66.068794,-8.470384,"does anyone else feel like this? so guys this is going to be a long post so prepare yourself if you want to read through it. this is my current situation i am years old and i live in a beach house, no i am not a trust fund kiddy but i could easily work days a week which is what i am currently doing and live there till my parents die. i dont want to do that though. i recently broke up with my gf weeks ago for alot of reasons, in a nutshell it ran its course, we still love and care about each other but its over and i am ok with that. i have worked numerous jobs. each and every single one of them i felt dead inside i have nothing against ppl who work if thats your thing good for you . the idea of working just makes me feel soo empty and unfulfilled and i fear if i went down that path for another years i would be in a forever empty void. i honestly could not see one happy co worker i have ever worked with, they were ethier fat obese, chronic smokers, alcoholics or had a norwood . i couldnt see one happy soul and that made me think wtf i am supposed to be that guy? i would not kill myself but i fear i could become a full time empty rotter untill the day i die. so that cancels that option. for the past years, i have been pursuing the entrepreneurial life as i know the isnt for me, i have tried alot of things with a little success but eventually it just fails. i am currently working on a social media agency. i have help from people, i currently have one trial client but i honestly feel no joy about it, the only thing i feel some sort of joy is that if i pull this off i wont have to sit in a x m cube. from my perspective i dont even feel passionate about entrepreneurship, i just feel like its the nd best option besides a x m cube. the guy that is helping me is location independent and even said he isnt even happy about the nomad life but he likes it way more then the and i feel that i would feel the same. i dont put effort in and i know objectively that you have to work your ass off to make it. part of the reason of going down the entrepreneurial path is because i want to be location independent. i honesty love travelling, meeting new people, experiencing new culture, i would have to say that is one of the very few things that make me happy, i thought about the whole work at a bar and travel thing but its really not appealing to me at all. my health my health i feel is going down hill, i feel sleep deprived all the time, alot of dizziness, sometimes i feel like for a split second i lose consciousness. i have like crazy irattic mood swings, i am talking about sometimes i feel super depressed and literally a minute later i feel happy. i could be depressed, it could be because i am so confused and ed up. my thoughts on depression is that of people are miss diagnosed. i believe the only point of anti depressants is for people who have a chemical imbalance in the brain. i am currently questioning if i have a chemical imbalance as i feel very little joy or happiness from anything in life anymore. guys i literally just laughed after reading it thats how ed up i am . anyone taken new mood? disconnected from society i am forever red pilled boyos. i feel so disconnected with society, that . of conversations are superficial and not real. the classic how are you today? is so funny when the person replies i am fine when if they started to be real their answer would be i am in a empty unfulfilled dark void . i feel that of ppl are not happy, they often just try and feel there empty lives with things such as holidays, technology, cars and the ever o mighty year mortgage. i even work for a business owner who earns figures and he is even dead inside often saying on friday is thank god its the weekend . i honestly feel that very few people actually see this world the way i do. i have isolated myself more and more over the past years to the point all i do is work days a week and on my days off i literally ldr and usually put in hours of work on my entrepreneurial activities. i would have to say i rarely go out to any meet ups with my friends, i have slowly chucked majority of people out of my life including family members such as cousins as i feel that all these people are just cope and are just as dead as me inside but they are not honest about it like i am. i have a couple of friends that are red pilled, they still try and cope but deep down i know if they dont change their lives, they will be as dead as me inside. i have often thought about going to therapy but i feel like if i mention how i feel they would just think to themselves christ i am as dead inside as this kid conclusion i just honestly dont know what to do with myself, i feel like a lost empty void going through life aimlessly with no feeling of joy or happiness. i am , i dont want to spend the best years of my life feeling like this, i would love to know if anyone has gone through this or have any advice?

what kind of god puts so much passion into someone only to take it away? i really do not feel like god really loves me. i was raised catholic but i am pretty sure i am agnostic in the sense that we just do not know what is out there. i believe in something greater but our interpretation is based off of a book that has been translated several times even from dead languages that is based off of the interpretation of a small group of people. all i am saying is that we just do not know what is out there. for all we know, god could have favorites and could have people that he does not like or people that he is meh about. i feel like i am the latter. i feel like he literally had enough spare parts to create another life so he thought why not and thus, here i am.",depression

5.192778,29.810774,"how to cure depersonalization? why do you feel unreal after smoking weed? i am cured! hello my friends, my name is ben. i felt unreal for almost two months before i figured out what was going on. this is what i learned why do you feel unreal and numb after smoking weed? you may have depersonalization derealization disorder ddd . ddd is a mental disorder, which causes you to feel unreal, numb, like in a dream or video game, two dimensional, as though you were looking through a pane of glass, disconnected from your body and or dissociative. i had depersonalization derealization disorder. since then, i have helped over a hundred different people who also had ddd, thus i know how it feels, what can cause it, the link between weed and ddd and what can help you get out. here we go! x b this is an article from my blog in which i describe the link between depersonalizaton and weed why do i feel unreal and numb after smoking weed depersonalization what is depersonalization derealization disorder? how do scientists categorize ddd? ddd is categorized as a nonpsychotic mental disorder and as a dissociative disorder the most important and scientifically accepted classification system is the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, icd . the icd classifies ddd under othernonpsychotic mental disorders . scientist in the united states of america more often use the classification system called diagnostic and statistical manuel of mental disorders dsm . here ddd is categorized as a dissociative disorder . how do scientists describe the difference between depersonalization and derealization? depersonalization is a mental disorder in which the patient feels unreal, fake, numb, as though they lack emotion and or is disconnected from their body. nevertheless, the patient still passes the reality check, meaning they notice that something is wrong. derealization is a mental disorder in which the patient perceives his or her surroundings as unreal, fake, two dimensional or as in a dream. nevertheless, the patient still passes the reality check, meaning they notice that something is wrong. how do i describe ddd? depersonalization, as well as derealization, are hell on earth. a state of mind i would wish on nobody, not even on my worst enemies. i had ddd for over four months, and for me, ddd is a protective mechanism, which is triggered by your mind when it feels things are getting out of hand. what do i mean by this? well, as soon as you exceed a certain anxiety threshold, this protective mechanism namely ddd is activated. it wants to help you cope with everything that is increasing your anxiety, consciously or unconsciously, which is a little paradox at first since ddd is super scary and boosts your anxiety levels, to begin with. this paradox makes ddd insanely difficult to get rid of. is there a link between weed and depersonalization derealization disorder? most people who smoke pot never develop ddd. nevertheless, a large percentage of people suffering from ddd state that it was triggered by marijuana. in a lot of cases, this change of state is accompanied by a panic attack. in my opinion, this distinction, whether it was due to weed, or the panic attack is essential for your healing process. why? well, if weed triggered it, i would lean more towards toxins in the body, specifically in the brain, being the cause of the ddd. in case of a panic attack induced ddd, it seems more likely, in my opinion, that the cause can be found in high anxiety levels due to unresolved trauma such as emotional abuse, death of a loved one, stress at work or even the birth of one s child. there might be another reason for weed being one of the main triggers of ddd, and it s called personalisation. what is personalisation? ddd most commonly occurs between the ages of and , adolescence and young adulthood. during this stage of life, adolescences start a path of self analysis, second guessing, questioning who they really are and finding their own identity. this youth identity crisis is called personalisation. marijuana is often used to explore one s inner worlds and can help find your own identity thus supporting an adolescence s path towards personalization. however, imagine the following scenario of an adolescent called mike, who is a highly sensitive youngster, searching for an identity, experienced childhood trauma and is about to smoke a joint. this joint may very well reveal overwhelming feelings and thoughts, which mike is not ready for, and thus instead of taking a step towards personalization, he dives into a nightmare called ddd. so, is there a link between weed and ddd? considering the high percentage of people stating that weed triggered ddd, there must be. nevertheless, weed could very likely be nothing more than a magnifying glass, giving you a closer look at your own self, which in many cases, admittedly, helps you find your own identity, but can also, in cases like mike, enforce you to lose contact to reality, welcoming ddd into your life. what can cause depersonalization derealization disorder? my observation is, as soon as your anxiety levels cross a certain threshold, your two new best friends mr. depersonalization and mr. derealization appear. i have dedicated countless hours to analysing the causes of ddd. hereby, considering not only my own experience but also the insights of all the people who have reached out to me. all my experiences, gathered facts and hours of reflection have led me to the belief that ddd appears when your anxiety level crosses a certain threshold. i believe every person carries this threshold within them, but most people s anxiety levels never reach this critical limit. nevertheless, some people do, and my observation is that the cause of this anxiety limit exceedance and thus of ddd, can be divided up into two main categories toxicity and trauma now every person is wired differently, consequently, trauma and toxicity will affect them differently. thus, everyone must use some self awareness to analyse themselves and figure out what s most likely to have caused their ddd. it s not necessarily an either or question, your ddd can have its origin in a combination of both. thus, i would try tackling anxiety due to toxicity and trauma. is weed toxic? x b is weed toxic and in consequence a possible cause for exceedance of the above mentioned anxiety threshold? to answer this question, we must understand what toxicity means. a substances toxicity level stands in correlation with the damage it does to the consumer. tetrahydrocannabinol in short thc is the principal psychoactive constituent in marijuana. thc is inhaled while smoking a joint, absorbed almost instantly from the lungs and passed on into the bloodstream. from here it is transported to the brain and slips through the blood brain barrier. here it works its magic, you get your high and then it disappears out of the brain again the same way it came, or it diffuses into the cerebrospinal fluid cfs , either way, it leaves the brain. thus, thc doesn t stay in the brain or nervous system meaning weed is not toxic, right? not completely. why? because in today s society a large amount of marijuana is laced with heavy metals . which heavy metals can be found in weed that can do severe damage to the consumer? arsenic cadmium mercury and lead the problem with these heavy metals is that they don t leave the brain as swiftly as thc. they tend to linger around and accumulate after passing the blood brain barrier. heavy metals have been linked to prominent mental disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. this leads me to believe that ddd might possibly also be negatively affected by these heavy metals, if not solely then at least partially. either way, we want to get out of ddd, and to do so anxiety levels must be decreased, heavy metals increase your toxicity levels and toxicity levels increase your anxiety, consciously or subconsciously. considering you want to get rid of ddd, every approach which has the potential of decreasing anxiety levels is beneficial, ergo get rid of those heavy metals. what can cure depersonalization derealization disorder i m sure by now you are wondering what you can do to cure ddd. sorry, but you will not like this answer. severe ddd in most cases last between six to twelve months, sometimes even longer. the six most important pillars and the first steps to recovery are understanding what you have knowing you re not alone knowing that thousands of people have gotten through ddd, so you can too! acceptance patience keep on going with your life now, this knowledge was great to come by, and it really is the foundation of curing ddd. nevertheless, it didn t really feel like this knowledge was getting me closer to my goal, which was getting rid of my ddd. i wanted to get out of ddd as fast as possible and i m sure you feel the same way, thus being patient and waiting six months wasn t an option. as a result, i tried everything, i mean everything and i will give you a list of what you can do, which could possibly decrease your time stuck in ddd. before i do though, i want to emphasize, every person is different, every person has different biochemistry, different past and different mental and physical health. meaning which one of the following tips, if any, will help you, i cannot say. also, please before you test the following suggestions go to your general practitioner and get yourself checked for any physical symptoms. get your blood tested and a ct, so you are sure nothing physical is wrong. after you have done this you can continue with my suggestions. we discussed ddd being caused by toxicity, trauma or a combination of both. i divided the following list into a toxicity and trauma approach section. i would recommend doing everything since everything on the list can decrease your anxiety levels, and which method works best for you, only you can know. so here we go toxicity visit a toxicologist try chelation therapy try these supplements enterosgel chlorella cleanse the digestive system st john s wort omega l theanine stress relief anti anxiety supplement the first three supplement suggestions had the largest impact on my ddd. thus, i can strongly recommend trying a supplement to cleanse the digestive system, enterosgel and chlorella. the other supplements were beneficial but not to the degree of the first three. trauma psychotherapy integrative manual therapy meditation sport healthy food if you need more help and or information check out my blog related questions does therapy cure depersonalisation?

he steps closer and says to just fucking stab him then. i say okay. homegirl once again saves the game, but the feeling is still with me from when i was tensing my muscles, threw my shoulders back, right foot back left foot forward, stabbing arm drawn and in my head i was deciding whether or not i should go for his solar plexus or his neck. the first time i chose his neck because it was the most likely move to work, but this time while i was deciding between the two and chose solar plexus and it just fucked me up. i hate this shit. it took several hours after it was over and done with to calm down, relieve myself of adrenaline and get myself out of survival mode. i do not want to hurt anybody and i tried so hard to keep myself out of that position and keep it on track, smooth and harmless. the escalation of events was entirely needless and only driven by his goal to jack my car and the strong grip meth psychosis has on him. at this point in my time stupidly immersing in street running, every situation with the nature of the one last night i have been incredibly fortanute. any day, any situation could be the one where i do not make it out alive. it is going to happen if i continue. so why the fuck is it so difficult for me to get away from that scene? all of my sober friends for whatever reason dropped me as soon as i got clean with no want for me back. so who the fuck does that leave me with? all those fuckers out there, doing shit like last night. i will be anchored to this town and area until however my court case plays out is over, but behavioral patterns and routines are largely based on environment. in this environment, street running is what i know and have concretely established over years of reinforcement. i need to get the fuck out, it is much easier to establish behavioral patterns and routines with a clean slate rather than completely revamp to the opposite of what you already have established. it is so against the grain and uphill. how in the fuck do i do that? i have done meetings, used to have sober friends, avoiding town completely, ignoring people, but i ca not get the momentum going and i always find myself back in my old ways. this is terrifying because while i am rockin and rollin through being clean right now, old patterns and behaviors all attract each other. i feel like if i do not entirely revamp my lifestyle, i am going to use again, and that is the last thing that i want. where the fuck do i start and how do i progress in a way that maximizes odds of success? i am sorry if this is all ridiculous but it is a genuine thing i am struggling to conquer.",drug_addiction

8.38116,24.083513,"debunking myths long term heroin use is unsustainable even if drugs are legalized, because if people get unlimited access to opioids their tolerance would grow more and more until they od. that is a post i was planning to make for some time now. it seems to be common sense that if one gets access to a unlimited supply of opioids, the person is tolerance would rise infinitely. this is unscientific and against all clear evidence concluded after extensive investigations. there are a ton of studies that prove opioid tolerance does not rise forever if one gets a unlimited supply, but it levels up. opioid tolerance gets stable at a certain dosage. the main therapeutic concerns are clearly not justified when confronted with outcome data from the swiss national cohort study. the average daily dosages increased slightly during the induction phase, due to a careful testing of the individually appropriate dose this was followed by a stabilization over about months and a decrease after months in treatment. also, when considering the various regimes of medications i.v. heroin only, combined with heroin that is smoked or oral methadone , the mean dose for injectable heroin decreased significantly over time. the treatment retention curve shows a continued decrease over years after about years, half of the patients had left the programme. conclusion therapeutic concerns about ever increasing dosages and permanent retention are not confirmed by outcome data. the role and function of heroin assisted treatment at the treatment system level. that means in switzerland not only the concerns about never ending increasing dosages was shown to be unjustified and not based on reality, but the exact opposite happened. the majority of addicts decreased their steady dosages over the years. gschwend p, rehm j, bl ttler r, et al. dosage regimes in the prescription of heroin and other narcotics to chronic opioid addicts in switzerland swiss national cohort study. european addiction research . this naturalistic descriptive study of dosages of patients in the swiss prove narcotic prescription program between found that heroin was most common as injection and as inhalation followed by oral methadone usually in combination with heroin . the authors concluded, during the course of treatment the mean dosage for injectable heroin per day decreased significantly and, depending on the treatment regime, almost linearly.. during the treatment period, dosages did not increase but generally decreased, indicating no further increase in tolerance. dosages declined even when patients chose their own daily regime. drug policy alliance annotated bibliography heroin assisted treatment concerns that hat may encourage drug use have proven unfounded. the emcdda and other reviews found that rather than patients increasing their heroin doses, they stabilised and often started reducing them, usually within two or three months, and uptake of other treatments also increased. hat also helped reduce heroin availability and recruitment of new users by medicalising use, and reducing street dealing and the number of user dealers. clinics are also sited only where a street injecting problem already exists, and have soon won strong support from the public when their effectiveness is demonstrated, for example being backed by a resounding majority in a national referendum in switzerland. heroin assisted treatment hat saving lives, improving health, reducing crime. changing the law or regulatory infrastructure to allow heroin prescribing, while important, has not driven all the positive outcomes listed below by itself. these outcomes also reflect the wider realignment from a criminal justice to a public health model, and the investment in services that has followed. however, the change in policy and law, much like the introduction of decriminalisation approaches in other countries, has helped facilitate this shift. health outcomes for hat participants improved significantly heroin dosages stabilised, usually in two or three months, rather than increasing as some had feared illicit heroin and illicit cocaine consumption was significantly reduced heroin assisted treatment in switzerland successfully regulating the supply and use of a high risk injectable drug. the upper limit for heroin was mg for single doses and , mg for daily doses. additional methadone doses for the night should not exceed mg. in the control group, the methadone dose was not specified cf. study protocol, krausz et al. . the average daily heroin dose across all patients and all study centres during the first study phase days is mg. it is markedly lower than in the dutch study, where the average dose was mg van den brink et al. . the mean daily dose of additionally prescribed methadone in the heroin group is mg with respect to all really issued methadone doses, which is also markedly below the additional methadone dose in the dutch study injection study mg, inhalation study mg . however, not all heroin patients received additional methadone. related to all heroin patients including those, who did not start treatment , . of the heroin group received additional methadone at least once during the study treatment. therefore, it is more meaningful to consider the average amount of additionally prescribed methadone related to all heroin doses, i.e. take into account methadone not issued or not claimed . then, the average dose of methadone additionally prescribed to heroin patients decreases to . mg per day. the german model project for heroin assisted treatment of opioid dependent patients a multi centre, randomised, controlled treatment study. that is, for a period of a whole year those heroin addicts from germany stabilized on mg per day. they could legally take up to a entire gram in separated doses, but less than half of that was enough for them. they became steady on less than half a gram as long as they got some additional methadone. the addicts from the netherlands could also use up to a gram of pure heroin daily, but they were satisfied and steady on just mg. the notion that long term legal heroin use would not be sustainable because tolerance would endlessly build and people would continue to od from legal heroin just as much as they die nowadays from illegal street dope because addicts will always be chasing the dragon more and more is false. the tendency is to decrease rather than increase the dosage when one gets unlimited access to opioids. diamorphine maintenance works. it is sustainable. it reduces crime. it improves health. it saves lives.",drug_addiction

not gonna get into that. i walk in, hug people, talk loudly to greet whoever is not in the entry way, and take my shoes off. well oh fuck wait there is a wad of cash and a bunch of fucking meth sticking out of my sock like the best tumor you could ask for. i have one arm that i can use efficiently and people looking at me, so as subtly as i could i slip those valuable into my shoe while i am bent down taking them off and moving them, my pocket would have been much too obvious. so we get to the table, eating and bullshitting, mom is runnin around being a flail bot , she is fuckin everywhere clearly gacked out of her mind. whatever though it is dinner, what do you expect? she leaves the dining room a few times, her constant changing of locations and tasks to not fully complete are beginning to be a background focus to the rest of us. about minutes we hear her call to us from the entry way, she informs she has to go to a bumfuck city in a different county and it is a little over an hour away. it is about at night and she suddenly needs to go this fucking instant. before anyone even has a chance to respond we hear the door shut and she is in her car. uuuuuhhhhh. okay. right. sure. what the fuck? now i know this is a fatty wall of text, and i promise i am sober as i am writing this, but up in the beginning i used the phrase, astromical in occurance. this is what i mean. the rest of us begin brainstorming joking about why she would have to leave so suddenly and to that place. the daughter i know best says, maybe she found a spider when she was doing her shaking and did not want to walk past it, so she turned around and went out the door. i do not know what the hell that means so i ask for elaboration. it turns out when momma gets gacked she starts shaking people is jackets and shoes for fucking spiders. not even kidding. she does not want any in the house and goes to extreme efforts to make sure it is that way. she shakes people is shoes for spiders. i fucking repeat, she shakes people is shoes for spiders. that is where my god damn money and meth is. my cash and my meth is quite literally my lifeline, you ca not fuck with that, but she took it all and dipped. i do not even know if i believe what i was told, maybe she knew i had something in my shoe, i do not know, but my god what an unlikely misfortune. like are you fucking kidding me with that. yes, it all should have been on my person, that is on me, but this consequence is just overkill. lesson learned i suppose. she actually has yet to come back to town is what i have been told. i have driven by a few times and her car is never there. so yeah there is the spider story. for those who were present for the conversation in which this story was requested, i am happy to share that my favorite lesbian tweaker duo is in fact together again, they just needed an adjustment of living arrangement. which they got. times in one day actually, i did not help unpack at the new living quarters at the end of the day because at that point it was just excessive.",drug_addiction

i am so scared, but i am completely capable of functioning and caring for my brother and managing his care, but this panic and these vivid images and replaying in my mind will not stop! the sound is stuck in my head, the feelings i had during the entire episode, the things i said to him, the fear i felt, everything feels so fresh and when i do sleep, i wake up and it seems more vivid almost like i only slept so i could have my batteries recharged so this could be replayed in better detail, the picture just gets more and more clear it seems. the first time i came home from the hospital after my brother was admitted, i pulled in my driveway and could not get out of my car because i was so scared to walk up to my porch, seeing the chairs in the position they were when we left via ems, everything was still in the same place, the cigarette that i dropped that burned me still on the porch because it had went out, the table slid out, the chairs knocked over.... it was too much so i sat in the car and just cried, i just could not get out and walk towards the porch. i had to have someone come downstairs with me to get a drink and food because just being in the kitchen alone and looking into the living room and not seeing my brother where he normally is every night listening to music was too scary, i could not be alone downstairs. little things like that, it seems to make no sense but it feels so frightening for some reason. i do not let my brother go outside alone to smoke, and he was smoking a lot today from stress i guess, and tonight just sitting outside i could not do it i just finally said please bro this is killing me, my brain is going crazy can we please go inside please....the way he was sitting identical, holding his phone the same, holding his cigarette, his feet on the column, it was like at any moment that horrid scream was going to happen again and that omg....so hard even typing this, it is just so scary what happens next. he had such a bad seizure that he stopped breathing completely, the air left his body i suppose this happened during the yell?

currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily, and frequently at that. i have even tried desensitizing to various methods, drowning etc by imagining them in depth. the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love, because my suffering has greatly exceeded it. as you are probably well aware, the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring child is or family suicide is unbearable for them. the grief it would cause my mother, who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great. my problems may seem unbelievable, but i assure you everything i am about to tell you is the truth, not embellished in the slightest. when i was i moved south in the uk to study. during that time i fell ill with mild depression and anxiety. nothing out of sorts, just mills problems. looking back now, it was probably the happiest time of my life. i lived well with other people and managed socially and at university. i worked regularly at health shops and other retail shops. by the third year of my course i had experimented heavily with drugs. this was fine, i was fine. i smoked cannabis regularly and was often in a blissful state at the end of the day, no worries. i fell into homelessness after my degree ended like a daydream or a fever. i had many friends, this was not something to worry about. i relished in this until things became serious. i stayed at multiple people is flats for months on end, supplying them with food to help. i was oblivious to my immediate situation and when the last person i knew and a good year of sofa surfing had ended i was stranded. by the time it had ended, i was only barely aware of the way i had been coping and that was with multiple opiates and cannabis. by the end of this period i had developed pretty severe social anxiety, characterised by sensorimotor ocd and an inability to communicate with new people without being completely aware of my expressions and movements. i had no option of my family helping me already asked for way to much and i turned to the local authorities. i was addicted to painkillers, unable to find a place to stay and lost. i eventually ended up in a hostel, and by all accounts was an absolute godsend. i lived with other temporarily homeless people and began working within the tjx industry. now with relatively few people i knew, i did not learn any of the things a person should try if thru felt depressed, angst or other side. nobody taught my how to cope. i continued opiate abuse and eventually quit my job. i was offered a move on flat by bht a local charity and it turned out to be the worst decision i could possibly have made. i would like to say now that this was bliss compared to what i experience right now. nothing could have prepared me for the physical and mental torture that was to come. this next section is something wrote about months ago. i would like you to read this and then i may continue. i will mark the section. my progression from a functioning human being to a total social recluse who is both now chronically physically and mentally unwell was rapid. there will be no exaggeration or embellishment in my writing and everything i say is true. i am glad i have found this place. following my university course, and subsequent mental health issues and drug abuse, i went through anxiety to anxiety, chronic depression to psychosis. none of the things that i just mentioned, while serious, even touch how much i have suffered in the last year of my life due to my living conditions, random illness and unlucky circumstances. i truly did not know what suffering was until this time. a few years after my degree i was not doing to well and i became homeless after i failed to find a house after i was sharing with others. i had a few minor friends that let me stay at their house, but nobody i was especially close to or a base in which i could reclaim my life. at this point i would like to mention, that while i do have family, i rarely have contact with them due to differences. at that point there is no circumstance where i would have been able to live at home. things progressed and i was declared homeless and sought hostels in a housing association in brighton called bht. i worked in retail and paid a portion of my rent and was getting better physically and emotionally and decided it was time to move. bht had a scheme in place where they would help you find somewhere to live and one day when the support workers came over as per usual on wednesday , they laid out in the table what was to be the worst thing that ever happened to me. i was shown an experimental housing project that consisted of shipping containers, much like those used in holland for students. we were provided with artist impressions and it looked very clean. best of all there we no deposits or rent in advance and the full rent was to be covered in full by the local housing benefit. i was immediately interested and began building a portfolio, which was required to sign up and and interview was to be taken. i did all the necessary paperwork and was invited to a group meeting with other tenants who has signed up. when i arrived we were briefed for a couple of hours. we were told about the location, how we would pay electricity etc. i made a good impression an was accepted and all the arrangements were made to move in. this is when it all began. my first experience with the containers was an ugly one. not only were they nothing like the artists impression, they were stuffed in front of a metal scrap yard and a pub which had just been demolished. i later found out that it was because of unsafe chemicals in the earth below the pub. these containers stuck out like a sore thumb and all i could think of when moving in was how much like prison it looked. boy was i right. but i had no right to complain, i had nothing and nowhere to go, this was a lot better than living on the street, or so i thought. about a month after i moved in the antics began. i remember after night of drunks and drug addicts screaming, shouting a fighting courtyard. people smashing up parts of the containers and ripping off postboxes. the front of the containers was a showcase to the road and with both front and back being glass windows the whole piece, with a door . since there was no lock or fob system, people from friday night and saturday night poured in and caused havoc. it is situated just at the end of london road, probably the worst part of the city. there is no gap between the containers, they are all lined up like prison cells and stacked straight in top of each other with corrugated stairs. people would stare and take pictures in the day. and they would mock me and trample around my front door in the evening. nobody is business was their own, if my neighbours were partying, everonr else had to put up with it and the stairs would fill with people jacking up or cracking up. i distinctly remember feeling utterly hopeless and alone one night when a group of men came to the top floor and stood looking at the road from outside my door. they had obviously been on a night out and some were drunk. i remember the words outside my container. if i lived here i would jump of this floor and kill myself and preceded to laugh and joke about what low life is must be here. a year later and things were getting atrocious. violent neighbours and their visiters ran rampage over the whole project. every night was the worse than i could have imagine. screaming, fighting, stabbings, rape and everything in between became normal. people would trash thier whole flats and scatter glass over the courtyard, and throw all of their rubbish in the bit just beside the containers. i would never have been able to dream up this madness. when i mean there were people screaming for hours on end, i mean it literally. residents absolutely off their minds running round naked and shouting at the top of their lungs for hours and hours on end. men assaulting women and there were cases of rape also. people flats were rushed for people seeking revenge for missed drug money. the place was completely out of control and the visits from the police and ambulances were so frequent, every one i heard go by i though was for the containers. this was every day and night, no exception. two people committed suicide. i have had people try my handle i was sleeping, try and break my door down and rush a flat i was speaking to a neighbour in looking to kill or beat to a pulp someone who has nothing to do with me. i had people asking me for money i. a daily basis and the walk up to my flat was hell with residents heckling me and wanting anything and everything from me. i made one friend there who was poet and wanted to help him record. he set up an anxiety talk in his flat for the good residents and we all made our case to the housing association and got many signatures for a petition to help with the project. we had frequent meetings with andy winter the ceo of bht. we all spilled our hearts out about how bad it was living here and how security cameras a gate lock etc needs to be set up. past the unrelenting crime and hellish neighbours was the cold. these containers got cold in the winter and the insulation was awful and the heaters were pathetic little ceramic tiles that did nothing. the electricity was on a meter system and i was spending at least just being warm. bare in mind most of these people got about every two weeks from the job centre. the housing association did nothing for about a year, when they finally implemented wooden insulation. i had a meeting with caroline lucas mp of brighton personally in a food bank i would vistit and she was sympathetic but there was little she could do to help. a few residents practically declared war on bht, and rightly so. they had ruined our lives and now where ignoring our cries for help, because of they did acknowledge the huge failure that the project was they would probably be shut down. i went to numerous newspapers whom ignored me as they were told they were not allowed to publish our stories. the only one which was actually published was only a few weeks after we moved in and was by my neighbour by this point i was struggling badly with mental illness again. i was depressed and highly angst with daily panic attacks. it did not help that the ventilation system was also poorly designed and i receive all of the drug fumes that come form the bottom floors i am at the top . this included ispice now banned in the uk smoke and i went to hospital frequently with chest pains. these fumes filled my flat all day long, so i spent a lot of time walking out of the house. this last year is when the hell occurred. someone moved in next door with severe anger issues. he would break the the flat into little pieces and blast his meter high speakers all day and night filed on speed and weed. i would wake up suddenly in the middle of the night sweating and my heart pounding, panicking due to sudden slams or smashes against my wall. there is barely any space between the walls. i began to have sleeping problems and insomnia that started worsening everything else. complaints were made to no avail, they tried to evict him bit it did not work and was a lengthy procedure. he was not the problem though, his visitor was. he was another tenant in the project and one that has caused problems before. what started out with a bit of neighbourly chatter tuned out to be the worst mistake of my life. i invited his the other neighbour in to play some video games and while we got along, i stopped inviting him in after it became apparent that he was an absolutely despicable human being. he recently had threatened to beat up a girl that i had to stop and was known to be causing issues, making people feel bad, but was not a major problem around the block. it became clear to me that this man was a secret demon. he began knocking door hard in the morning and after ignoring him for weeks i would eventually answer and tell him i do not want to see him. he would take this as an oppurtunity for an argument and harass me further. he deluded himself into thinking we were friends and became aggressive when i poiletly told him and sinhalese to him that we were not. he thought he could do whatever around and in my flat. he stated trying my handle daily, sometimes even without knocking and this went on for months and months and months. i asked him to stop but he would not. i told him my anxiety and insomnia was getting so bad due him and my other birth our that i am going insane. he carried on trying my handle and door daily, sometimes for hours on end. this was the worst. i shouted at him told him to leave numerous times but it carried on. if you have ever had someone debase you on such a level you will know how damaging that is. someone who dictated when you sleep or wake and knows there is nothing you can do about it because they have nothing to lose and you do. i could not fight him because he would probably take it further. the sound of handles going stated to evoke a horrible physical response, one which would affect me for weeks on end. i could not call the police because that would put me in a dangerous situation for being a isnitch . there was no point in telling my housing association, there is nothing they could have done that would not put me in a worse situation. along with an already desperate situation and a very loud neighbour and another who took it upon himself to make my life a living hell i began to get seriously physically ill. the present day i began suffering with horrible fevers and viruses, symptoms that can only be described as like having the flu for months and months last year and they have not stopped. i had about bloods taken over the course of the year and the doctors ca not figure out why i am the state i am in. when i talk about this i ca not stress enough how much i do not mean this lightly. i have had the nora virus while withdrawing from diazepam and that did not touch the physical suffering i have had every day for the past year. raised cortisol and adrenaline have left me incapacitated and completely ravaged my body, i know all of this stress is to blame. coupled with dreadful hypervigilance and severe insomnia the suffering had been something i would not wish on the most evil person. i began to lost my mind and become so derealised and depresonalized that i do not know how to concentrate or relax. i cant do anything i live like play instruments or listen to music without the content dear that someone might hear and start harassing me. the insomnia has been so bad i have been nearing hospitalization and the only reason i am here today is that i managed to escape for a few months back to a friend in gloucestershire. i have wanted to commit suicide for such a long time, but i never will because of how much it would hurt certain family members, even though i do not have contact with them often. just to be clear, i dont take alcohol or drugs and have not for a long while. i eat a very healthy diet and exercise force myself daily and practice standing medidtation pretty much impossible with the though of him being around for the last months the loud neighbour has been evicted, but the other one the real problem is still around. every time i enter the gate is like the walk of the gauntlet, whether i will see him he is often around and have to deal with him. having gone to my friends house in gloucestershire i got back to find out i could not get back in because someone had tried to break in and snapped something in my lock. i am completely aggrophobic. i never see anyone than people at the supermarket and when i enter the gate i practically run up to my flat, stuff the curtains with cloths so they ca not see the lights when i have them on a night and make barely any noise at night. someone else has moved in and the evil man has started going into his flat talking to him. i ca not believe that that after a horribly loud neighbour who attached the evil man i am the first place has now been evicted, the next one is also inviting him up and will probably soon give the man a reason to start knocking me again under the guise of friendship. i know he is around because i hear him shouting laughing outside my flat and i know he has knocked me once or twice in the last week. just after christmas, i did everything i could to move to a different county. i found the only place that i had a possibility of moving to was bournemouth and an agency called dwp housing, due to their low fees and no deposit. i got a citizen is card and went there took the form in and they accepted my referencing. i was invited to view a flat when i received a call from the wan i was dealing with saying they would not be corresponding with me any further. i found out that my housing association had been talking with her and told her i was in rent arrears, which i was not. i was in water debt and service charge with confused her. but she did not ask me before sending the emails and ruined my chances. i have been to the council, the waiting list is unbelievably long, even with medical needs. everywhere else i have been wants in fees deposit which i currently have no way of saving. because of living in a hostel even though i am i am now entitled to the one bed rate of any country, unless i move into shared, in which case that privilege will be revoked. at this point i do not care where i go, i would happily take anywhere else in the country, whether it be a hostel or otherwise. every day is a battle to keeping on going and i have no one sleds to talk to. that is was what i wrote a while ago in a forum dealing with neighbours. following the containers, i was able to get a loan and finally move out of them for good. i move to another part of the country, completely on my own, did not know anyone at all. i since have developed a depersonlization disorder following the end of the containers. i became so detached, i may have walked on separate occasions for odd miles a day for months. it occurred one night last christmas when i returned from a visit to my family is house. it is an absolute miracle that i was able to leave, and i was so optimistic that i began doing everything in my power to make myself well. i eat a perfect diet, i exercise daily and do everything i can. the chronic insomnia stayed and the dissociative symptoms have reached a point where my awareness levels are very worrying and borderline insane. i spend whole days trying to take on various stimulus took regain awareness. i try to take in sounds a sights, but everything has lost meaning. i ca not appreciate a beautiful lake or a song, because i am not here or there, i am nowhere. i feel like some sort of blood supply has been cut to important regions of my mind that i can only beg for help about. the fevers randomly come and go, even away from the containers and most days i wake up feeling physically awful. i cannot control my body temperature and wake up, i feel flu like again and again, which is how it began before. my muscles ache unbearably all day, i have to walk slow and when i exercise i do it out of fear of death. my body is simply fucked and no doctor can explain it. i clearly have something wrong but it ca not be explained, probably because it is so complex or a virus so deep, it ca not even be found. i have had over blood tests in the last year. around two weeks ago i developed a very loud tuning in my ears. it is severe tinnitus that is making everything i do meaningless. the last thing that i had in the world after moving was peace and quiet at night and that had been taken from me. there is no sight of it going and it did not follow acoustic trauma. i can see myself rapidly declining in the past few weeks. this is becoming a joke. i have begun to think that this is some sort of test. i am being referred to a new psychiatrist,a sleep clinic and the community psychiatric team in my area and hopefully a neurologist. i now have no friends and speak to family maybe once a month. i exist only because i do not want to hurt those who may feel pain from my death. i love my year old grandmother too much to burden her in her last year is and my mother would be distraught. i am approaching a stage where my suffering is so great, that there would have been numerous times that if i would had access to a gun, i would definitely would have killed myself. the fear of drowning, hanging or falling is great. i want to die, i want others to accept that i want to die. i have been looking into possible euthanasia. i am close to the end. if you have read that all, i thank you that is all i ask.",suicidality

homeless individuals this year. i am usually as nice as i can be no matter how mean some people can get, because i know that you do not attract bee is with vinegar but i am very terrible with words and making them sound the way i want them to. i have always had a problem with this...ever since i was a small child. i never sought help for it and i feel like if i did... things might have turned out a lot better... let is start off with current events i moved two hours away from my immediate family the only isupport i had left to be with my on and off boyfriend of four years. i made this move in october of . let me start off by saying i love this guy.... a lot. honestly too much. no he does not die or get hurt or anything like that he is here for graduate school and moved here about . years into our relationship. i told him i could never do a long distance relationship as i am just not strong enough for them, but after . years i was already to the point to where i just could not let go. i stuck it out for a year and a half years and would work a part time job and it got to the point to where every single day i had off i would drive out the two hours to see him, and sometimes even drive two hours back the same night just to see him for an hour or so a week. it was a bit rare that i did not stay the night, there were times where i spent days, sometimes even a week, but most of the time it was only days at most. he told me that once i had about in my savings, and i could land a job here he wanted me to move in with him. the problem is this dude is , and ca not talk to his parents about anything. they are paying for everything his apartment, his monthly allowance, his gas, they got him his car for free his late grandmothers car you name it. now that is not saying he is not capable of getting these things on his own, he is just been under his parents thumb from what i can assume his whole life they are not abusive or anything but the relationship marriage between his mother and father is honestly one of the worst ones i have ever seen that does not involve any sort of domestic violence. about his family skip ahead if you do not care too much his father is a lawyer with his own practice, but spends his money on literally everything he thinks is a good deal i am not supposed to tell anyone this but oh well he ended up spending half a million dollars i think ? on a yacht. a huuuuuuuuuge yacht. that just sits at the dock in florida. it did not work when he bought it, it does not work now. it landed their family into a rather large amount of money issues debt buying the thing, and now he has to pay docking fees every month. he provides for his entire family because his mother does not work and has not worked in over years iirc. she just stays home and plays on her tablet all day and does laundry and cooking i believe. she is nice in person, but never really much cared for me. would never even allow me into her house when she had not even met me even though i would constantly drive out to see him and bring him goodies and things he only lived about minutes away he has two brothers, one older , and one younger . the younger brother has high mid functioning autism. works at little ceasars and then stays home and plays video games all day aside from doing little chores here and there. he is pretty darn cool, and although i have never seen it i have heard can get pretty angry. his older brother is like the perfect specimen of roid rage. this dude is like reptar on wheels screams and cusses at his mom and shit he went to medschool what a surprise and ended up losing his medical license or residency or something bad like that i think not supposed to talk about that either so i am just gunna leave it at that so both of them live at home with the parents, but the older brother actually just got a residency in arkansas or one of those states that starts with an a so i think he is moving out soon i am usually kept in the dark as far as his family matters probably for the best. i was the only one who told him he should not go to gradschool he did not want to at all but thought that is what he had to do since his undergrad degree did not enable him to really get a job anywhere bio science idk his words not mine i told him that i do not care if we lived in a trailer or apartment for years as long as i was with him and we did it together blah blah those stupid romantic words that do not seem rational in the slightest but i meant them with every ounce of my being....and still do sadly. anyway skipping on because i am growing more tired by the second. i got a job offer that paid me almost double what i was making, had in the bank, new to me car hyundai azera. within the first week of moving in, he could not possibly tell his parents in fact he could not tell his parents that we were a thing at all. so he hid that from them. he did not let me know that he would be hiding this information from his parents until after the first week i moved in, i had to drop on a hotel room for two nights because his mother was staying over for a few nights and he could not possibly let her know that i was living there. needless to say we would get in fights because if i were to come to him about anything he did that upset me, it was usually small things, it would usually start a chain reaction of just pure raw you did this and you did that that would get brutal he never laid his hands on me excluding the times i begged him not to leave and he threw and pushed me to the ground. aside from that we were the happiest peas in a pod together. we got on super well and had the same amount of passion for everything that we did together... any...way... i banked everything on this guy, the past years, burned all my bridges, even planned my future around him i did not go to school college so that i could be around when he needed me for support. i work hours a week to support myself in this apartment i ended up getting near his because he told me that is what it would take, that it would make this work. he will be so sweet and amazing and everything i fell in love with do everything for me and just be amazing and supportive. until i agree to dating him again........ as soon as i say yes or we classify each other as boyfriend and girlfriend he becomes a totally different person. and trust me i can get pretty rowdy bad at times but within the past few months he is said things like you make me feel like shit you treat me like shit i just want you to treat me the same way i treat you i deserve better than you and i have made sure to never say things like that to him.... every time we would fight he would just get up and leave or hang up on me and constantly interrupt me. i ca not even bring myself to tell someone they do not deserve me it is not my right to say something like that... and i have had online friends because they are easy to acquire with internet points ! tell me that he is no good for me, or that i need to leave him or i deserve better but as soon as i would leave and find someone new he always came back. he always found a way to get me to come back, and i say that but i have loved him more than i have loved anyone else before... and that is where i messed up i think. he is lied to me point blank about dumb things for years like i am really busy with schoolwork i do not have time to talk and so i will hop on my xbox to play something and there he is online playing games for hours a day which i could not literally give less about but the fact that he is years old and has felt the need to lie to me about this kind of stuff since almost day one ? the worst he is ever done was lie to me about looking at local craigslist porn ads , so i am not sure if he is cheated on me but i do not think he would ever do that kind of stuff but he sure did go through a lot of local hook up ads while my google chrome was still signed in............. anyway point is i have allowed myself to go beyond rationale. beyond the point of sane... over this. i lose my mind all the time, i ca not eat or sleep.... i ca not find motivation in anything. i am letting him win... i tell him i need to talk to him and he tells me he will have to let me know later when he is available while he is playing xbox when we planned for days to hang out these days. this is the same guy who would text me all the time and have amazing fun conversations and now that we are dating he goes at least hours a day without saying anything and when he does it is just bare... how is work have a good day i hope you feel better soon sorry you are upset i am telling myself to hold on until tuesday because that is when my father scheduled a therapist session for me... that is when i get to see my father again... i hold the smallest amount of hope that if therapists can help people who have been through so much worse that it might work for me too but... i am really hard to get through to me, it is so hard for me to find a good enough reason to convince myself i am not just a waste of money or resources. my parents would beat me as a kid... spoiler that was unexpected if i had bad grades or if i had a bad attitude they would hit me very very hard with whatever they could find over and over again. there was one time where i counted to lashes and begged them not to do more than .......... he stopped at it was because i had d is on my report card.....which is bad yes i completely understand but.... maybe if the punishment would have been something else ? i do not know anymore... there was a time when i was my dad drug me by my hair on the floor from my room to the livingroom a good ft i think just because i stated that if he laid his hands on me i would have to call the police... later that night when i was asleep he came into my room and sat on my bed crying... stroking my hair telling me that he was so sorry... i would never not once laid a finger on my parents okay i did once because my mom slapped me across the face so i slapped her across the face because after years of this shit but she knocked me on my ass so i learned my lesson nor threatened them with anything other than my own safety. my mother would constantly go through my diary or go through my room. i never did drugs or drank alcohol so i am not sure why she would feel the need to do all of that stuff... there was one time that i knew she read my diary, so i wrote in it one night that she is a bitch and should stop reading my stuff i was and sure enough the next day after i got home from school i received another whipping which involved them beating my ass to the point to where i looked like i was about to pass out from crying so much. i never stayed out or hung out with any bad kids my parents would not let me go anywhere until they had met the other person is parents first this was the rule all of my life even through senior year of highschool so needless to say i did not have many friends because no one my age wanted to get their parents to meet mine just so they could hang out with me. i am an awful artist because all i had to do was stay home and be alone and draw and watch tv most of my childhood... after drawing all these years i am still not very good at it. i was raped as a kid spoiler woah again ? and the first person i ever told was my ex boyfriend alan i did not want to tell anyone else because it was a cousin who did it and i did not feel like i was worth causing a rift in the family. fast forward years later my mom dug through my stuff while i was out at my job on the special needs bus as a school aid i loved that job and found a note alan had written to me where we discussed it she ended up screaming at me when i got home about it out of no where thinking he said my father did it i explained to her that it was not him but i did not want to talk about it because it happened so long ago and i never wanted to tell anyone about it in the first place she did way more harm than good instead of being sympathetic she was very mad that i never told her how dare you i ca not believe you you are disrespectful because you lie etc. only much louder..... she threatened me to tell her who did it this lasted hours. i made her promise not to tell anyone, so i told her it was my cousin matthew. not hours later she called matthew is mother and asked her to meet her for dinner the next day and told her. our families no longer talk to each other. but now i do not know what i would do without my parents... i would have been gone months ago, honest. about two years ago i was so sick of my mother is abusive way of speaking... talking to everyone especially me. . . i grabbed a pair of scissors thinking if i would just threaten myself a little, a tiny cut maybe she would see that i am serious. unfortunately i was way more upset than that, and the amount of pressure i applied landed me an ambulance ride, the scariest day hospital stay ever, the most pain i have ever felt and stitches. but to be honest i would do it all over again because it worked. my mother single handedly transformed into the most amazing, sweet mother that i needed my whole life...because of what i did. my brother that is years younger than i is so talented, successful, and loved very much. he is got an amazing girlfriend, an amazing car, an amazing job and i could not be happier for him ! i am very loved too i was just never able to gather the motivation or courage as easily as he was. and to be honest with myself, i am pretty sure i was a great distraction to my parents for them to lay off of him they were always on me about attitude if i did not respond with a clear robotic yes mam or no sir if i ever tried to explain myself or stick up for myself i got the belt. i assume they realized how it essentially ruined me as far as mentally because they did not do it with my brother. that and he learned quick i imagine. i am just another one though... i am not sure why a few of my friends died so early why john died in a car wreck after graduating college why the only friend i have left had to get cancer....i ca not even be there for her, i ca not even support her. why could not that just happen to me ? i do not have anything to be proud of.... i never accomplished anything... i walked a few blocks home in the thunderstorm today... the car my mother sold to me was totaled a few months ago due to a wreck that was deemed no one is fault ... i was soaked to the bone and have done absolutely nothing but bathe, and sit on the couch and stare at the wall while i write this... i have been home for almost hours. i was able to buy that car because the sweetest guy in the whole world whom i have only met one time, gave me out of the bottom of his heart to help me get a new vehicle. and has not asked for a penny back and still sends me money to help me... he spent over just to meet me. . . he lives in california but i... i am going to stop... what is the point of writing all of this... i am so sorry i could not be better. i am sorry i let the small things overwhelm me. i am sorry ca not be strong like you riley... you will beat this cancer i know it. i am sorry mom and dad, but i did this to myself you know ? i did not learn fast enough and that is okay you wo not believe me but it is not your fault. it is mine.",suicidality

paul who introduced me to drugs. he took it all way too far and the drugs became almost an addiction for him. i say almost, because there was no particular drug he was addicted to, it was the feeling of escapism that i think he craved more than any particular high. in the end, years ago now, i could not deal with him any more. he did a couple of things that are pretty irrelevant to my story but they showed me once and for all that he would never ever put me first no matter how hard i tried. so i broke up with him. that was a heartwrenching decision because i totally loved him. i have so far only given his bad side, he is a very good guy! quiet, friendly, polite, funny, adventurous, creative, sensitive alltogether pretty loveable. we have had some really good times together and get on amazingly well, even now. for a few years he has been bumming about, taking drugs, hanging with the wrong people , you know, the usual. he is not had any other girlfriends as far as i know, he was pretty angry at me for.. probably about a year, but after that seemed to decide he was ready to be friends again. i take him out for drives, go to visit him around once a week, txt back when he wants someone to talk to. i enjoyed having him back as a friend but knew he still was not happy. it seems that he has not moved on in that time and a few months ago he told me that not only am i his best friend i am also the only person he is ever loved, the only one he can trust. i am, apparently, perfect to him and perfect for him. bollox, that is what i say. i am not perfect and we are far from perfect for each other! if that were the case things would have worked out very differently between us. also, i have a new boyfriend now. we got together not long after i broke up with paul. new guy i do not think i can remember what is going on if i have to use more than one fake name is great and i am totally happy with him. i have no intention of breaking up with him. phew! that was a much longer backstory than i expected! ok, the last month so paul has been feeling very very down, he was having some problems with some new girl who pretended she liked him then had sex with our mutual friend, then kissed another of our mutual friends. she is younger than i am, remembering that paul is older than me. i think she is too young to know how much harm her actions can cause. paul has subsequently fallen out with the previously mentioned friends and moved somewhere else, about half an hour away from everyone. i still go to visit once a week ish and keep in contact, but i have a job and a bf so ca not be there all the time. about a month ago i got a txt from him at about pm saying goodbye, basically.. he declared his love for me, thanked me for everything and told me that he did not want to bring everything down any more. he was too much of a burden, no one would ever love him and he did not want to be found. he was found eventually and had taken lots of paracetamol. he needed to have his stomach pumped but was ok. i told the hospital that i did not think he should be on his own, that i know his history and his mental health state and when he is that down he will do anything to hurt himself. i have had a few friends that have tried to kill themselves i know right, was it something i said? and they have immediately been admitted to the psychiatric unit in the hospital and been kept there for several weeks. i assumed this is what they would do with paul. nope, chuck testa! they sent him home! the next day! on his own! after he overdosed! wtf reddit? present day i told you so is usually just a little bit satisfying. not today. yesterday i woke up to another txt, similar to the one i described before. this one told me his pin number, where he had hidden his bank card, that he had nothing to gain from living, no one will love him, he is a failed side project and a mistake. he said the harder he tries the worse he fails. it says that he will miss me, he has been pining for me but that he is full of helpless feelings and the badness has to stop now. it ended saying he is sorry for what he is. how freakin awful is that?? what do you say to that? well, obviously i did not say anything, i tried to call him, could not get through, realised he would sent it a few hours before, freaked out for about seconds then called an ambulance. i really thought he was dead by that point, all because i would slept through a txt message. he was not though, luckily. he would taken a lot of valium that time that he would bought off a friend, passed out then woke up feeling really groggy to the paramedics knocking on his door. so after all that craziness you would expect me to say that he is now safely tucked up on the psychiatric ward, yeah? nope! wtf is wrong with people?? he is genuinely and glaringly obviously a massive danger to himself. i know this, i am sure you by now know this. why do they not know this? what do you have to do to get sectioned these days? this time i called in backup straight away in the form of his dad, he went nuts, but the staff at the hospital say that they believe support within the community is the best thing for paul because his problems will still be there when he comes back out . what?? is that surely not the same for everyone? unless they are phobic of something very unusual... like solar eclipses? i do not understand. that brings me to... question finally! i hear you exclaim. am i missing something here? can any of you see a reason why paul would not be admitted under the mental health act? he has told them personally that if he had the chance he would try to kill himself again. question in your opinions should i be trying harder to get paul admitted since i think he will try to hurt himself again? question he says he still loves me and wants to be around me as much as possible. i do not know if this is a good thing. i feel like i am helping by taking him out and about, having fun days, but could i be doing the wrong thing here? am i making him think that the only time he can be happy is with me? how can i show him that is not the case? question he is going to be signed up for incapacity benefit. this, in my opinion, is a bad idea. he needs to get out and do things, find a job, do some good, have a reason to get up in the mornings, make some money and above all meet new people and make friends. i understand this will be reeeeeeally freakin hard at first, but surely if he had an occupational therapist or something he she could help him find a job he can manage and even enjoy. what do you think? am i asking too much from the system? question this is probably the hardest one how do i make him happy? or at least not so full of self loathing? i can cheer him up temporarily, that is very easy, but not for long. how do i make him see what a great guy he can be? how do i prove he is not ugly and horrible and worthless? i would like a quick fix depression cure please any and all advice is really appreciated. i love my friends and want to help but sometimes i am at a loss for what to do or say next. i am afraid to leave him for too long in case he tries this again. i ca not have him at my house because he is no longer welcome stole from parents, see paragraph , ca not go and stay with him he has a single bed, i have a new boyfriend. see paragraph and ca not go there every day because i have a job, and other friends, and a family. it is really emotionally draining to be the one and only person a suicidal person will talk to. does anyone have any success stories after having been in a similar situation? he does not have a computer or i would have sent him to reddit by now. lolcats brighten up my day. thanks in advance.",suicidality
